===Vital Signs Table===
This table represents a minimum set of vital sign concepts, the required LOINC codes ([[Argonaut Vital Signs]]), and UCUM units of measure codes ([[Argonaut Vital Signs Units]]) used for representing vitals signs observations.  These are [[Implementation_Guide#Extensible_binding_for_CodeableConcept_Datatype|extensible bindings]] defined for this IG and require that when a system support of any of these vital signs concepts, they must represent them using these codes.  In addition, if you have a blood pressure observation, you must have both a systolic and a diastolic component, though one or both may have dataAbsentReason instead of a value.

Alternate codes may be provided in addition to the standard LOINC and UCUM codes defined here.   An example of [[Implementation_Guide#Using_multiple_codes_with_CodeableConcept_Datatype|using multiple codes]] is provided.  Other profiles may make rules about which vital sign must be present or must be present as part of a panel.

Vital Signs | 8716-3 | — | This is the top-level grouping structure for a set of vital signs.  It has no value in Observation.valueQuantity ; instead, it just includes related links (with type=has-member) to the Observations in this set (e.g. respiratory rate, heart rate, BP)||[Vital Signs Panel Example](todo.html) Note that querying for the panel may miss individual results that are not part of an actual panel.
