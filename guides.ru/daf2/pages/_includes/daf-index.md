[Data Access Framework (DAF)] : is an U.S initiative sponsored by the Office of the National Coordinator [ONC].  DAF has multiple implementation guides, each one addressing a different set of use cases and requirements. These implementation guides are described below

1. [DAF] : The DAF IG defines all the supported conformance requirements for accessing patient data.  These requirements were developed, ballotted, and published in FHIR DSTU2.  They have been updated to reflect changes in the FHIR STU3 and content introduced by DAF-Core. (see below).  The DAF IG is being balloted with an STU status.
1. [DAF-Core] : The DAF-Core IG defines the minimum mandatory conformance requirements needed for accessing data for a single patient. These requirements have been developed based on the [Argonaut] pilot implementations. Implementations of the DAF-Core IG will be completely compliant with the Argonaut program. The DAF-Core IG is being balloted with an STU status.
1. [DAF-Research] : The DAF-Research IG defines the conformance requirements for capabilities used by researchers to access data about multiple patients. These requirements have been developed based on the [PCORnet].  The DAF-Research IG is being balloted as "For Comments only ballot".
