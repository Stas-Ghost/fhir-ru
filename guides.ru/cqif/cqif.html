<h4>Background</h4>

<p>The CQF Implementation Guide is sponsored by the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Information (CQI) HL7 Work Groups, with input and coordination from the FHIR Infrastructure and Service Oriented Architecture HL7 Work Groups.</p>

<p>The Clinical Quality Framework initiative has focused on harmonizing the historically disjointed specifications used by the Clinical Quality Measurement and Clinical Decision Support communities. Specifically, the initiative has focused on the specifications used to represent knowledge artifacts within the two communities. The strategy employed has been to break the conceptual content of knowledge artifacts into three core components:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Metadata - Descriptive information about the artifact and its content</li>
	<li>Clinical Information - The representation used to carry clinical information about the patient or population of concern within a given artifact</li>
	<li>Logic - The representation used to convey the logic involved in the artifact</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Clinical Quality Framework Conceptual Components" src="cqframework-components-diagram.jpg"/>

<p>The first component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=391">Clinical Quality Common Metadata Conceptual Model</a>, an informative document harmonizing metadata requirements between Quality Measurement and Decision Support artifacts.</p>

<p>The second component has resulted in the QUICK <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=378">Conceptual</a> and Logical Models, a harmonization of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=338">Virtual Medical Record (vMR)</a> used in Decision Support and the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">Quality Data Model (QDM)</a> used in Quality Measurement, and realized in FHIR as the QICore profiles.</p>

<p>And finally, the third component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=400">Clinical Quality Language Specification</a>, a harmonization of the expressive capabilities of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=337">Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification (CDS KAS)</a> (produced by the Health eDecisions (HeD) S&amp;I Framework Initiative), and the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=97">Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF)</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the ongoing CQF initiative pilot efforts, these developing specifications are being used to support knowledge artifact sharing, as well as evaluation of knowledge artifacts as part of decision support request/response and measure evaluation.</p>

<p>This implementation guide continues the harmonization of quality domain specifications by defining an approach to using a FHIR server as a component of a knowledge system in one of two roles:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Knowledge Repository - As a knowledge artifact repository for sharing and distributing knowledge artifact definitions</li>
	<li>Knowledge Service - As a knowledge service providing for the evaluation of patient data and clinical context using knowledge modules such as decision support artifacts and quality measures.</li>
</ol>

<p>As such, this implementation guide references resources in the base specification, as well as defines profiles that support multiple use cases in the clinical quality improvement and measurement space. From the perspective of a Knowledge Author, this IG specifies the approach to representing knowledge artifacts within FHIR.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a Knowledge Content Provider, this IG defines search functionality for using a FHIR server as a knowledge artifact repository.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a Knowledge Service Provider, this IG defines operations and profiles in support of evaluating quality measures, and defining a service for guidance request and response, consistent with the approach taken by the current Decision Support Service specification.</p>

<p>And finally, from the perspective of a Knowledge Service Consumer, this IG defines the expected available operations and behavior of a knowledge service.</p>

<a name="scope"/>
<h4>Scope</h4>

<p>This implementation guide focuses on several primary use cases:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sharing - The representation of computable, shareable knowledge artifacts</li>
	<li>Evaluation - The evaluation of a particular patient or population using knowledge artifacts</li>
	<li>Distribution - Functionality required to enable a searchable artifact repository</li>
</ul>

<p>The sharing use case is the focus of the <a href="cqif-knowledge-artifact-representation.html">Representing Knowledge Artifacts</a> topic, which covers how to use the various types and resources defined within FHIR to represent computable knowledge artifacts such as Event-Condition-Action rules, Documentation Templates, Order Sets, and Quality Measures.</p>

<p>The evaluation use case is discussed in the next three topics, <a href="cqif-integrating-decision-support.html">Integrating Decision Support in a Clinical Workflow</a>, <a href="cqif-documentation-templates.html">Using a Documentation Template in a Clinical Workflow</a>, and <a href="cqif-order-sets.html">Using an OrderSet in a Clinical Workflow</a>, which cover how to use the various decision support artifacts in a clinical workflow.</p>

<p>The distribution use case is discussed in the <a href="cqif-knowledge-artifact-distribution.html">Sharing Knowledge Artifacts</a> topic, which covers how to use the Search Parameters defined for each of the resources to expose and retrieve knowledge artifacts.</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="cqif-quality-reporting.html">Quality Reporting</a> is covered in a separate topic focused on how to use the Measure and MeasureReport resources to define and report on quality measures.</p>

<li>
<b>SHALL</b>: an absolute requirement for the particular
element. Where a SHALL constraint is applied to an XML element, that
element must be present in an instance when the cardinality is greater than zero.
Where a SHALL constraint is applied to an XML attribute, that attribute must
be present, and must contain a conformant value.
</li>
<li>
<b>SHALL NOT</b>: an absolute prohibition against inclusion</li>
<li>
<b>SHOULD/SHOULD NOT</b>: best practice or recommendation. There may be valid
reasons to ignore an item, but the full implications must be understood and
carefully weighed before choosing a different course

<a name="ballot-objectives"/>
<h4>Ballot Objectives</h4>

<p>For this ballot cycle, we are presenting this implementation guide as an STU ballot with the objective of providing a basis for the representation and evaluation of shareable clinical knowledge artifacts. We welcome any comments, criticisms and suggestions on any topic, but in particular, we seek feedback on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The use of FHIR operations as the protocol for defining artifact evaluation requests and responses. In particular, the ability to bundle multiple requests into a single operation, as well as the use of a generic FHIR operation for any module evaluation, versus defining an evaluation specific to a given knowledge module.</li>
	<li>The use of FHIR interactions in general as a mechanism for enabling knowledge module repository and distribution functionality.</li>
</ul>
