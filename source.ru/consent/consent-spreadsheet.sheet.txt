  Requirements = In the context of a consent, the topic is the matter under consideration in regards to which specific rights, privileges, obligations, restrictions, and prohibitions are binding on any grantor and grantee parties upon the execution of the consent. \nGiven the wide range of consent topics, implementers need to be cognizant of the business use case for which they are designing a FHIR Consent, and narrowly specify the topic being represented with respect to the Consent.type and any specializing Consent.subtype. \nThe same topic, e.g., an asset such as a good or service, such as a real property, medical supply, insurance, information, a procedure or employment, or a manner of conduct, such adherence to a privacy, trust, or security policy, may be the topic of multiple types of consents. \nOne way to determine the Consent.topic is to answer the question: “What is the object of negotiation?”\nAnswer: The Consent.topic, which may be described with more detail in the [0..*]Consent.valuedItem @ [0..1] Consent.valuedItem.entity[x] Definition: Specific type of Consent Valued Item that may be priced. CodeableConcept|Reference(Any)\nConsent.topic is “the what” that a grantor is exchanging with a grantee in return for some benefit. \nConsent.topic is “the what” to which any Consent.action is being applied for any stipulated Consent.action.reason. \nAConsent.topic is “the what” governed by the execution of the consent to which any party’s rights, privileges, obligations, restrictions, and prohibitions apply.
  Comments = The Consent.topic may be an application for or offer of a policy or service (e.g., uri to a consent directive form or a health insurance policy), which becomes the Consent once accepted by both the grantor and grantee. \nThe Consent Resource may function simply as the computable representation of the executed consent, which may be the attached to the Consent Resource as the “binding” or as the “friendly” electronic form.  For example, a Consent Resource may be automatically populated with the values expressed in a related QuestionnaireResponse. \nHowever, the Consent Resource may be considered the legally binding consent if it is the only “executed” form of this consent, and includes the signatures as *The Consent Resource may function as the computable representation of an application or offer in a pre-executed Consent if the grantor has not entered any values.  In this case, it is populated with values in a “legal” form of the application or offer or by the values in an associated Questionnaire.  If the grantor has filled in the legal form or the associated Questionnaire Response, then these values are used to populate a pre-executed Consent Resource.\nIf the Consent.topic is considered an application or offer, then the policy is often required to be attached as the “legal” basis for the application to ensure “informed consent” to the consent, and that any discrepancy between the application and the policy are interpreted against the policy.  Implementers should check organizational and jurisdictional policies to determine the relationship among multiple representations of a consent pre- and post-execution.
