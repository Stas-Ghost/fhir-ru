  Element = MedicationAdministration.identifier
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Identifier
  Short Label = External identifier
  Definition = External identifier - FHIR will generate its own internal identifiers (probably URLs) which do not need to be explicitly managed by the resource.  The identifier here is one that would be used by another non-FHIR system - for example an automated medication pump would provide a record each time it operated; an administration while the patient was off the ward might be made with a different system and entered after the event.  Particularly important if these records have to be updated.

  Comments = If only a code is specified, then it needs to be a code for a specific product.  If more information is required, then the use of the medication resource is recommended.  Note: do not use Medication.name to describe the administered medication. When the only available information is a text description of the medication, Medication.code.text should be used

  Binding = MedicationAdministrationMethod
  Short Label = How drug was administered
  Definition = A coded value indicating the method by which the medication is intended to be or was introduced into or on the body.  This attribute will most often NOT be populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  For example, Slow Push, Deep IV.
  Comments = One of the reasons this attribute is not used often, is that the method is often pre-coordinated with the route and/or form of administration.  This means the codes used in route or form may pre-coordinate the method in the route code or the form code.  The implementation decision about what coding system to use for route or form code will determine how frequently the method code will be populated e.g. if route or form code pre-coordinate method code, then this attribute will not be populated often; if there is no pre-coordination then method code may  be used frequently.

  Element = MedicationAdministration.dosage.dose

  Comments = If the administration is not instantaneous (rate is present), this can be specified to convey the total amount administered over period of time of a single administration.
  v2 Mapping = RXA-6 Administered Amount / RXA-7 Administered Units

 -- Row 21 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Ratio| SimpleQuantity
  Short Label = Dose quantity per unit of time
  Definition = Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient.  Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.  Other examples:  200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.
  Comments = If the rate changes over time, and you want to capture this in MedicationAdministration, then each change should be captured as a distinct MedicationAdministration, with a specific MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate, and the date time when the rate change occurred. Typically, the MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate element is not used to convey an average rate.
