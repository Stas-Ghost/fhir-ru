=== Sheet trigger-type =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = named-event
  Display = Named Event
  Definition = The trigger occurs in response to a specific named event, and no other information about the trigger is specified. Named events are completely pre-coordinated, and the formal semantics of the trigger are not provided

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = periodic
  Display = Periodic
  Definition = The trigger occurs at a specific time or periodically as described by a timing or schedule. A periodic event cannot have any data elements, but may have a name assigned as a shorthand for the event

  Code = data-changed
  Display = Data Changed
  Definition = The trigger occurs whenever data of a particular type is changed in any way, either added, modified, or removed

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Context = TriggerDefinition
  English = Either timing, or a data requirement, but not both
  XPath = not(exists(f:data)) or not(exists(*[starts-with(local-name(.), \'timing\')))
  Expression = data.empty() or timing.empty()
  Severity = error

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Context = TriggerDefinition
  English = A condition only if there is a data requirement
  XPath = not(exists(f:condition)) or exists(f:data)
  Expression = condition.exists() implies data.exists()
  Severity = error

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition
  Type = Type
  Short Name = Defines an expected trigger for a module
  Definition = A description of a triggering event. Triggering events can be named events, data events, or periodic, as determined by the type element
  Comments = If an event is a named-event, it means the event is completely pre-coordinated, and no other information can be specified for the event. If the event is one of the data- events, the data and condition elements specify the triggering criteria. The data element specifies the structured component, and the condition element provides additional optional refinement of that structured component. If the event is periodic, the timing element defines when the event is triggered. For both data- and periodic events, a name can be provided as a shorthand for the formal semantics provided by the other elements

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.type
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = TriggerType
  Short Name = named-event | periodic | data-changed | data-added | data-modified | data-removed | data-accessed | data-access-ended
  Definition = The type of triggering event

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.name
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Name or URI that identifies the event
  Definition = A formal name for the event. This may be an absolute URI that identifies the event formally (e.g. from a trigger registry), or a simple relative URI that identifies the event in a local context
  Comments = An event name can be provided for all event types, but is required for named events. If a name is provided for a type other than named events, it is considered to be a shorthand for the semantics described by the formal description of the event

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.timing[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Timing|Reference(Schedule)|date|dateTime
  Short Name = Timing of the event
  Definition = The timing of the event (if this is a periodic trigger)

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.data
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = DataRequirement
  Short Name = Triggering data of the event
  Definition = The triggering data of the event (if this is a data trigger)
  Comments = This element shall be present for any data type trigger

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.condition
  Card. = 0..1
  Short Name = Whether the event triggers
  Definition = A boolean-valued expression that is evaluated in the context of the container of the trigger definition and returns whether or not the trigger fires
  Requirements = Need to be able to formally describe the triggering criteria
  Comments = This element can be only be specified for data type triggers and provides additional semantics for the trigger. The context available within the condition is based on the type of data event. For all events, the current resource will be available as context. In addition, for modification events, the previous resource will also be available

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.condition.description
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Natural language description of the condition
  Definition = A brief, natural language description of the condition that effectively communicates the intended semantics

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.condition.language
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = ExpressionLanguage
  Short Name = text/cql | text/fhirpath | etc
  Definition = The media type of the language for the expression

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = TriggerDefinition.condition.expression
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = Boolean-valued expression
  Definition = An expression that returns true or false, indicating whether or not the condition is satisfied
  Comments = The expression may be inlined, or may be a simple absolute URI, which is a reference to a named expression within a logic library referenced by a library element or extension within the containing resource. If the expression is a FHIR Path expression, it evaluates in the context of a resource of one of the type identified in the data requirement, and may also refer to the variable %previous for delta comparisons on events of type data-changed, data-modified, and data-deleted which will always have the same type
