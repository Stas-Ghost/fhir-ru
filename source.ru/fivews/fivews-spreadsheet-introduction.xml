<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
This is <b>NOT</b> a resource.  It is not part of the FHIR schema and cannot appear directly in FHIR instances.  It is a logical model that defines a pattern adhered to by
other resources.  This pattern serves two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It offers guidance to work groups designing resources and helps ensure consistency of content created by different work groups</li>
  <li>It provides a standard "view" that might be useful for implementers in processing and manipulating all resources that adhere to the same pattern.  (Tooling that supports
  this may become available in a future release.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the guidance here is around the types of information that might be captured, not around element names.  For example "why" would more typically be labeled as something like "reason" and "where" would be more typically labeled "location"
</p>
<p>
An "event" is any description of an activity that has already taken place or that is currently ongoing.  It includes resources that primarily describe the "result" of an activity 
or what was found (e.g. a condition or observation).  Examples include encounters, procedures, completed questionnaires, representations of state transitions, etc.  It does not 
include resources that describe objects or roles (e.g. patient, device, location).
