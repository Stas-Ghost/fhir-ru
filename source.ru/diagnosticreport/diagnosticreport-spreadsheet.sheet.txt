  Short Label = A Diagnostic report - a combination of request information, atomic results, images, interpretation, as well as formatted reports
  Definition = The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on patients, groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from these. The report includes clinical context such as requesting and provider information, and some mix of atomic results, images, textual and coded interpretations, and formatted representation of diagnostic reports.
  Requirements = To support reporting for any diagnostic report into a clinical data repository.
  Comments = This is intended to capture a single report, and is not suitable for use in displaying summary information that covers multiple reports.  For example, this resource has not been designed for laboratory cumulative reporting formats nor detailed structured reports for sequencing.

  Requirements = Need to know where in the patient history to file/present this report
  Comments = If the diagnostic procedure was performed on the patient, this is the time it was performed. If there are specimens, the diagnostically relevant time can be derived from the specimen collection times, but the specimen information is not always available, and the exact relationship between the specimens and the diagnostically relevant time is not always automatic.

  Requirements = Need to be able to track completion of requests based on reports issued and also to report what diagnostic tests were requested (not always the same as what is delivered)
  Comments = Note: Usually there is one test request for each result, however in some circumstances multiple test requests may be represented using a single test result resource. Note that there are also cases where one request leads to multiple reports.

  Requirements = Need to support individual results, or report groups of results, where the result grouping is arbitrary, but meaningful. This structure is recursive - observations can contain observations

  Definition = One or more links to full details of any imaging performed during the diagnostic investigation. Typically, this is imaging performed by DICOM enabled modalities, but this is not required. A fully enabled PACS viewer can use this information to provide views of the source images.
  Comments = ImagingStudy and ImageManifest and the image element are somewhat overlapping - typically, the list of image references in the image element will also be found in one of the imaging study resources. However each caters to different types of displays for different types of purposes. Neither, either, or both may be provided.

  Requirements = The provider of the report should make a comment about each image included in the report.
  Comments = The comment should be displayed with the image. It would be common for the report to include additional discussion of the image contents in other sections such as the conclusion.
