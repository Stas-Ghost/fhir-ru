  Summary = y
  Type = uri
  Short Name = Logical uri to reference this {{title}} (globally unique)
  Definition = An absolute URL that is used to identify this {{title}} when it is referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance. This SHALL be a URL, SHOULD be globally unique, and SHOULD be an address at which this {{title}} is (or will be) published. The URL SHOULD include the major version of the {{title}}. For more information see [Technical and Business Versions](resource.html#versions)
  Requirements = Allows the {{title}} to be referenced by a single globally unique identifier

  Element = MetadataResource.purpose
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = markdown
  Short Name = Why this {{title}} is defined
  Definition = Explains why this {{title}} is needed and why it has been designed as it has
  Comments = This element does not describe the usage of the {{title}} (See, e.g, the comments element, or relatedArtifacts), rather it\'s for traceability of \'\'why\'\' the resource is either needed or \'\'why\'\' it is defined as it is.  This may be used to point to source materials or specifications that drove the structure of this {{title}}
