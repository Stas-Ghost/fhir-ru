<h2>Extended Operations on the RESTful API</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a> defines a set of common interactions performed on 
a repository of typed resources (read, update, search, etc). These interactions follow 
the RESTful paradigm of managing state by Create/Read/Update/Delete actions on a set of identified 
resources. While this approach solves many use cases, there is some specific 
functionality that can be met more efficiently using an RPC-like paradigm,
where named operations are performed with inputs and outputs. This specification 
describes a light operation framework that seamlessly extends the RESTful API. 
</p>
<p>
Operations have the following general properties:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Each operation has a name</li>
 <li>Each operation has a list of 'in' and 'out' parameters</li>
 <li>The parameters are either resources, data types or search parameters</li>
 <li>The operations are subject to the same security arrangements as the RESTful API</li>
 <li>The URIs for the operation end points are based on the existing RESTful API address scheme</li>
 <li>The operations may make use of the existing repository of resources in their definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: the definition of these services does not prevent the use of other 
kinds of services not dependent on or integrated with the RESTful API.

<h3>FHIR defined Operations</h3>
<p>
This specification defines several operations:
</p>
<%operationslist%>
<p>
Implementations are able to define their own operations in addition to
those defined here. Name clashes between operations defined 
by different implementers can be resolved by use of the 
<a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a>.
</p>

<a name="defining"> </a>
<h3>Defining an Operation</h3>

<p>
Each Operation is defined by:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A context for the operation - system, resource type, or resource instance</li>
 <li>A name for the operation</li>
 <li>A list of parameters, with their definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each parameter, the following information is needed:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Name - the name of the operation. For implementer convenience, the name should be a valid token (see below)</li>
 <li>Use - In | Out | Both</li>
 <li>Type - a data type, a search parameter type, a resource type, or "Document". Out parameters must have a type which is a resource</li>
 <li>Documentation - describes its use</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that search parameter types are allowed for use where the parameter is used as a search parameter
i.e. to link between the context of operations, and a set of existing resources that the operation refers
to, where as data types and resources are used to provide information directly to the operation. The
definition of a parameter should make it's use clear.
</p>

<h3>Executing an Operation</h3>

<p>
The URL for an operation end-point depends on its context:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>system: the url is [base]/$[name]</li>
 <li>resource type: the url is [base]/[type]/$[name]</li>
 <li>resource instance: the url is [base]/[type]/[id]/$[name]</li>
</ul>

<a name="request"> </a>
<h4>Operation Request</h4>

<p>
In the general case, an operation is invoked by performing an HTTP POST to the operation end-point.
The content of the body is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.2">multipart/form-data</a> that 
contains the parameters for the operation. Where the parameter type is a data type or resources, the content
may be represented as either json or xml; for a datatype, the root name of the object is the 
name of the parameter. 
</p>
<p>
Some notes about this format:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>For resources and data types, a Content-Type header SHOULD be provided, but may not be if the content is submitted by an HTML form</li>
 <li>For an example of an operation, see <a href="op-example-request.html">the value set expansion request example</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
If there is only one complex parameter (e.g. a parameter where the representation is XML or JSON, not a search parameter),
then the operation can be performed by an HTTP POST with the complex parameter as the body of the post, and the 
other parameters appended to the URL in the search portion of the URL (e.g. after the "?").
</p>
<p>
If there are no complex parameters to the operation, the operation may be invoked by performing an HTTP GET
operation where all the parameters are appended to the URL in the search portion of the URL (e.g. after the "?").
</p>


<a name="response"> </a>

<h4>Operation Response</h4>

<p>
If the operation succeeds, the HTTP Status code is 200 OK. An
HTTP status code if 4xx or 5xx indicates an error. User agents should 
note that servers may issue redirects etc to authenticate the client 
in response to an operation request.
</p>

<p>
The result of the operation is a <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundle</a> containing 
zero or more resources. Note that the same arrangement as the RESTful interface applies
in regard to <a href="http.html#mime-type">content types</a>.
</p>
<p>
Identifying out parameters by name....

</p>
<p>
The resources that are returned by the operation may be 
retained and made available in the resource repository 
on the operation server. In that case, the server will 
provide the identity of the resource in the bundle ientry identifiers. When
resources that are not persisted are returned in an atom feed,
they should be assigned a cid: identifier that will never 
be re-used.
