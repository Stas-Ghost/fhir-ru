These examples illustrate the use of the Library resource to share quality measurement and improvement logic as a FHIR resource.

The first example is the Chlamydia Screening Common library developed as the running example in the Author's Guide of the Clinical Quality Language specification.

The next two examples are derived from the Exclusive Breastfeeding Measure and are referenced by the <a href="DecisionSupportRule.html">DecisionSupportRule</a> and <a href="Measure.html">Measure</a> examples, respectively.
