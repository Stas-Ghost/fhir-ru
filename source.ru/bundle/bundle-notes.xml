<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Conceptually, a bundle is a list of resources with some context (named links, and status on the entries)</li>
<li>Since a Bundle is itself a <a href="resource.html">Resource</a> it has the common metadata, including profile assertions, tags, and security labels</li>
<li>Bundle has a 'base' element, which is used to resolve relative references present in the bundled resources. In the case that the bundle includes resources with different bases, 
each entry can also assert it's applicable base if this is different to the overall base. Each resource SHOULD have a base provided</li>
<li>Applications reading a bundle should always <a href="references.html#bundle-refs">look for a resource</a> by its identity in the bundle first before trying to access it by its URL.</li>
</ul>
