<h2>Security and Privacy Module</h2>

<a name="intro"> </a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Security and Privacy Module describes how to protect a FHIR server (through
access control and authorization), how to document what permissions a user has
granted (consent), and how to keep records about what events have been
performed (audit logging and provenance). FHIR does not mandate a single
technical approach to security and privacy; rather, the specification provides
a set of building blocks that can be applied to create secure, private systems.

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
FHIR is focused on the data access methods and encoding leveraging existing Security solutions.
Security in FHIR needs to focus on the set of considerations required to ensure that
data can be discovered, accessed, or altered only in accordance with
expectations and policies.  
Implementation should leverage existing security standards and implementations to ensure that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All communications can be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. 
</li>
<li>
No information leaks when errors occur
</li>
<li>
No active script content can be injected into narrative resources
</li>
<li>
Full audit trails can be constructed and used to detect anomalous access patterns
</li></ul>
<p>
For general security considerations and principles, see <a href="security.html">Security</a>.
Please leverage mature Security Frameworks cover device security, cloud security, big-data security, service-to-service security, etc.
See <a href="https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building_blocks/mobile_device_security"> NIST Mobile Device Security</a>
and <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Mobile_Top_10_2016-Top_10">OWASP Mobile Secuity</a>. 
These security frameworks include prioritized lists of most important concerns.

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>

Privacy in FHIR includes the set of considerations required to ensure that
individual data are treated according to an individual's Privacy Principles. FHIR
includes implementation guidance to ensure that:

</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Individual preferences can be communicated through standards-based protocols
  (e.g., OAuth, User-Managed Access) or using an explicit FHIR representation
  (<a href="consent.html">Consent</a>) </li>
<li>
  Resources can be tagged to indicate the sensitivity or confidentiality of the data they represent (<a href="security-labels.html">Security Labels</a>)
</li>
<li>
  Data access records and audit logs can be shared with individuals, e.g. for accounting of disclosures (<a href="auditevent.html">Audit Event</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>
<a name="authorization"> </a>
<h4>
Authorization and Access Control
</h4>

<p>

<em>Use case:</em> A FHIR server should ensure that API access is allowed for
authorized requests, and denied for unauthorized requests.

</p>

<p>

<em>Approach:</em> Authorization details can vary according to local policy,
and according to the access scenario (e.g. sharing data among
institution-internal subsystems vs. sharing data with trusted partners vs.
sharing data with third-party user-facing apps). In general, FHIR enables a
separation of concerns between the FHIR REST API and standards-based
authorization protocols like OAuth. For the use case of user-facing third-party
app authorization, we recommend the OAuth-based SMART protocol 
see <a href="security.html#authentication">Security: Authentication</a> as an
externally-reviewed authorization mechanism with a real-world deployment base â€”
but we note that community efforts are underway to explore a variety of
approaches to authorization. 
For further details, see <a href="security.html#binding">Security: Authorization and Access Control</a>.

</p>
<a name="User Identity and Access Context"> </a>
<h4>
User Identity and Access Context
</h4>

<p>

<em>Use case:</em> "Access to protected Resources are enabled though user Role-Based, 
Context-Based, and/or Attribute-Based Access Control."

</p>

<p>

<em>Approach:</em> Users should be identified and should have their Functional and/or Structural role 
declared when these roles are related to the functionality the user is interacting with. Roles should 
be conveyed using standard codes from <a href="valueset-security-role-type.html">Security Role Vocabulary</a>.
</p><p>
A purpose of use should be asserted for each requested action on a Resource.  Purpose of use 
should be conveyed using standard codes from <a href="v3/PurposeOfUse/vs.html">Purpose of Use Vocabulary</a>.
</p><p>
When using OAuth, the requested action on a Resource for specified one or more purpose of use and 
the role of the user are managed by the OAuth authorization service (AS), and may be communicated 
in the security token where jwt tokens are used.

For details, see
<a href="security-labels.html#hcs">Security: HCS vocabulary</a>.

</p>

<a name="audit"> </a>
<h4>
Audit Logging
</h4>

<p>

<em>Use case:</em> "A FHIR server should keep a complete, tamper-proof log of
all API access and other security- and privacy-relevant events".

</p>

<p>

<em>Approach:</em> FHIR provides an AuditEvent resource suitable for
use by FHIR clients and servers to record when a security or privacy relevant
event has occurred. This form of audit logging records as much detail as
reasonable at the time the event happened. 
The FHIR AuditEvent is aligned and cross-referenced with IHE Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) Profile.

For details, see
<a href="security.html#audit">Security: Audit</a>.

</p>

<a name="privacy-consent"> </a>
<h4>
Privacy Consent
</h4>

<p>

<em>Use case:</em> "Documentation of a Patient's Privacy Consent Directive - rules for Collection, Use, and Disclosure of their health data."

</p>

<p>

<em>Approach:</em> FHIR provides a Consent resource suitable for
use by FHIR clients and servers to record current Privacy Consent state. The meaning of a consent or the absence of the consent is a local policy concern.
The Privacy Consent may be a pointer to privacy rules documented elsewhere, such as a policy identifier or identifier in XACML.
The Privacy Consent has the ability to point at a scanned image of an ink-on-paper signing ceremony, 
and supports digital signatures through use of <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a>.
The Privacy Consent has the ability to include some simple FHIR centric base and exception rules. 
</p><p>
All uses of FHIR Resources would be security/privacy relevant and thus should be recorded in an <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a>. 
Those access qualifying as a Disclosure should additionally be recorded as a Disclosure, see <a href="auditevent-example-disclosure.html">Disclosure Audit Event Example</a>.
</p><p>
For Privacy Consent guidance and examples, see
<a href="consent.html">Consent Resource</a>.

</p>
<a name="provenance"> </a>
<h4>
Provenance
</h4>
<p>
<em>Use case:</em> "All FHIR Resources should be capable of having the Provenance fully described."
</p>
<p>
<em>Approach:</em> FHIR provides the Provenance resource suitable for
use by FHIR clients and servers to record the full provenance details: who, what, where, when, and why. 
A Provenance resource can record details for Create, Update, and Delete; or any other activity. 
Generally Read operations would be recorded using  <a href="auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a>. 
Many Resources include these elements within, this is done when that provenance element is critical to the use of that Resource. 
This is <a href="w5.html">overlap is expected and cross-referenced on the W5 report</a>.

For details, see
<a href="provenance.html">Provenance Resource</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Use case:</em> "For any given query, need Provenance records also."
</p>
<p>
<em>Approach:</em> Given that a system is using Provenance records. 
When one needs the Provenance records in addition to the results of a query on other records (e.g. Query on MedicatioRequest), 
then one uses reverse include to request that all Provenance records also be returned. 
That is add <code>?_revinclude=Provenance:target</code>. 

For details, see <a href="search.html#revinclude">_revinclude</a>.
</p>


<a name="signature"> </a>
<h4>Signature</h4>
<p>
<em>Use case:</em> "Digital Signature is needed to prove authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation."
</p><p>
<em>Approach:</em> FHIR Resources are often parts of Medical Record, or are communicated as part of formal Medical Documentation. 
As such there is a need to cryptographically bind a signature so that the receiving or consuming actor can verify authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.
This functionality is provided through the signature element in <a href="provenance.html">Provenance</a> Resource. 
Where the signature can be any local policy agreed to signature including Digital Signature methods and Electronic Signature.

For details, see
<a href="security.html#signatures">Security: Digital Signatures</a>.
</p><p>
Digital Signatures bind cryptographically the exact contents, so that any changes will make the Digital Signature invalid. 
When a Resource is <a href="http.html#create">created</a>, or <a href="http.html#update">updated</a> 
the server is expected to update relevant elements that it manages (id, lastupdated, etc). 
These changes, although expected of normal RESTful create/update operations, will break any Digital Signature that has been calculated prior. 
One solution is to create the Digital Signature after the REST create operation completes, one must first confirm that the resulting 
created/updated Resource is as expected, then the Digital Signature is formed.
</p><p>
A variation of this happens in Messaging, Documents, and other interaction models. 
For details, see 
<a href="updates.html">Ramifications of storage/retrieval variations</a>
</p>

<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>

<p>
In the STU3 release, FHIR includes building blocks and principles for creating
secure, privacy-oriented health IT systems; FHIR does not mandate a single
technical approach to security and privacy.
</p>

<p>
 In future releases, we are anticipate including guidance on:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
incorporate the SMART on FHIR authorization specification,
for user-authorized apps, 
</li>
<li>
methods for organization-to-organization authorization,
</li>
<li>
more details about how to use digital Signatures for data integrity and
non-repudiation, including an approach that supports some level of manipulation
of resources (e.g. separating the entries in a bundle, or conversion between
XML and JSON during processing),
</li>
<li>
more detailed Consent management, including support for specific consent use cases.
</li>
</ul>
