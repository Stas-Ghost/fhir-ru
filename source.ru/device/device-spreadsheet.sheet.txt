  Type = Identifier
  Short Label = Instance identifier
  Definition = Unique instance identifiers assigned to a device by manufacturers other organizations or owners.
  Comments = The barcode string from a barcode present on a device label or package may identify the instance, include names given to the device in local usage, or may identify the type of device. If the identifier identifies the type of device, Device.type element should be used.  For [UDI](device.html#5.11.3.2.2),  this element corresponds to the variable portion of the UDI that identifies the serial number of a specific device. See [UDI mappings](device-mappings.html#udi) for a complete mapping of UDI parts to Device.
  UDI Mapping = The serial number which is a component of the the production identifier (PI), a conditional, variable portion of a UDI.   The identifier.type code should be set to “SNO”(Serial Number) and the system left empty.

  Comments = The udiCarrier string may identify an unique instance of a device, or it may only identify the type of the device. The Human Readable format (HRF) is required in FHIR. AIDC identifiers cannot be conveyed in FHIR, Because of limitations on character sets in XML and the need to round-trip JSON data through XML.  See [UDI mappings](device-mappings.html#udi) for a complete mapping of UDI parts to Device.
  UDI Mapping = The full UDI carrier - The Human Readable Form (HRF) representation of the barcode string as printed on the packaging of the device.  The  \'type\' component should be set to “UDI” and the \'system\' component to the the appropriate repository url.  the additional URL is needed to identify the authoritative source for UDI generation within the jurisdiction.  All UDIs are globally unique within a single namespace. with the appropriate repository uri as the system.  This allows a recipient of a UDI to know which database will contain the UDI-associated metadata.  For example,  UDIs of devices managed in the U.S. by the FDA, the value is  http://hl7.org/fhir/NamingSystem/fda-udi.  Because of limitations on character sets in XML and the need to round-trip JSON data through XML, AIDC identifiers cannot be conveyed in FHIR.

  UDI Mapping = The device identifier (DI), a mandatory, fixed portion of a UDI that identifies the labeler and the specific version or model of a devicet.  The system uri should be included.
