<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
Placeholder for discussion of splitting ImplementationGuide.  This resource is focused on use-cases for the ImplementationGuide after the publication process is complete, specifically:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exposing metadata relevant for exposing an implementation guide in a registry</li>
  <li>Information necessary to support using the implementation guide for instance validation (what resources are part of the IG, what default profiles are declared and imported/contained guides)</li>
  <li>Information an IG authoring tool requires when refrencing a previously published IG as a dependency, including what artifacts are defined and what links are allowed.</li>
</ul>
