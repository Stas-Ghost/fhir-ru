  Display = Sentence Group
  Definition = A group of related alternative items is a sentence group if the target referenced by the item is the same in all the items, and each item simply constitutes a different variation on how to specify the details for the target. For example, two items that could be in a SentenceGroup are \"aspirin, 500 mg, 2 times per day\" and \"aspirin, 300 mg, 3 times per day\". In both cases, aspirin is the target referenced by the item, and the two items represent two different options for how aspirin might be ordered for the patient. Note that a SentenceGroup would almost always have an associated selection behavior of \"AtMostOne\", unless it\'s a required item, in which case, it would be \"ExactlyOne\"
