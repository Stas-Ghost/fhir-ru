In both cases, aspirin is the target referenced by the item, and the two items represent two different options for how aspirin might be ordered for the patient. Note that a SentenceGroup would almost always have an associated selection behavior of \"AtMostOne\", unless it\'s a required item, in which case, it would be \"ExactlyOne\"
