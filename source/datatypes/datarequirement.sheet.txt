 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement
  Type = Type
  Short Name = Describes a required data item
  Definition = Describes a required data item for evaluation in terms of the type of data, and optional code or date-based filters of the data

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.type
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = FHIRAllTypes
  Short Name = The type of the required data
  Definition = The type of the required data, specified as the type name of a resource. For profiles, this value is set to the type of the base resource of the profile

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.profile
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = uri
  Short Name = The profile of the required data
  Definition = The profile of the required data, specified as the uri of the profile definition

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.mustSupport
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = string
  Short Name = Indicates that specific structure elements are referenced by the knowledge module
  Definition = Indicates that specific elements of the type are referenced by the knowledge module and must be supported by the consumer in order to obtain an effective evaluation. This does not mean that a value is required for this element, only that the consuming system must understand the element and be able to provide values for it if they are available. Note that the value for this element can be a path to allow references to nested elements. In that case, all the elements along the path must be supported

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter
  Card. = 0..*
  Short Name = What codes are expected
  Definition = Code filters specify additional constraints on the data, specifying the value set of interest for a particular element of the data. Each code filter defines an additional constraint on the data, i.e. code filters are AND\'ed, not OR\'ed

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.path
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = The code-valued attribute of the filter
  Definition = The code-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path must be resolvable from the type of the required data. The path is allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements. Note that the index must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type code, Coding, or CodeableConcept
  Comments = The path attribute is a limited subset of FHIRPath that allows path traversal, but not calculation

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.valueSet[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = uri|Reference(ValueSet)
  Short Name = Valueset for the filter
  Definition = The valueset for the code filter. The valueSet and code elements are additive. If valueSet is specified, the filter will return only those data items for which the value of the code-valued element specified in the path is a member of the specified valueset

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.codeFilter.code
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Coding
  Short Name = What code is expected
  Definition = The codes for the code filter. If values are given, the filter will return only those data items for which the code-valued attribute specified by the path has a value that is one of the specified codes. If codes are specified in addition to a value set, the filter returns items matching a code in the value set or one of the specified codes

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.dateFilter
  Card. = 0..*
  Short Name = What dates/date ranges are expected
  Definition = Date filters specify additional constraints on the data in terms of the applicable date range for specific elements. Each date filter specifies an additional constraint on the data, i.e. date filters are AND\'ed, not OR\'ed

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.dateFilter.path
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = The date-valued attribute of the filter
  Definition = The date-valued attribute of the filter. The specified path must be resolvable from the type of the required data. The path is allowed to contain qualifiers (.) to traverse sub-elements, as well as indexers ([x]) to traverse multiple-cardinality sub-elements. Note that the index must be an integer constant. The path must resolve to an element of type dateTime, Period, Schedule, or Timing
  Comments = The path attribute is a limited subset of FHIRPath that allows path traversal, but not calculation

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = DataRequirement.dateFilter.value[x]
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime|Period|Duration
  Short Name = The value of the filter, as a Period, DateTime, or Duration value
  Definition = The value of the filter. If period is specified, the filter will return only those data items that fall within the bounds determined by the Period, inclusive of the period boundaries. If dateTime is specified, the filter will return only those data items that are equal to the specified dateTime. If a Duration is specified, the filter will return only those data items that fall within Duration from now
