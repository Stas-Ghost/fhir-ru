=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext
  Type = Structure
  Short Label = Describes the context of use for a module
  Definition = Specifies clinical metadata that can be used to retrieve, index and/or categorize the knowledge artifact. This metadata can either be specific to the applicable population (e.g., age category, DRG) or the specific context of care (e.g., venue, care setting, provider of care)
  Requirements = Consumers of the module must be able to determine the intended applicability for the module. Ideally, this information would be used programmatically to determine when and how it should be incorporated or exposed
  Comments = When multiple applicability attributes are specified, this means that all the attributes are applicable to this context. For example, if a gender and age group is specified, a patient must match the specified gender and age group for the asset to be considered applicable
  Committee Notes = This data type was defined to support reuse of the pattern of contributor elements across multiple conformance and knowledge asset resources

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.patientGender
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = AdministrativeGender
  Short Label = Patient gender
  Definition = The gender of the patient. For this item type, use HL7 administrative gender codes (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.1)

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.patientAgeGroup
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = Demographic category
  Definition = A patient demographic category for which this artifact is applicable. Allows specification of age groups using coded values originating from the MeSH Code system (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.177). More specifically, only codes from the AgeGroupObservationValue value set are valid for this field  [2.16.840.1.113883.11.75]
  To Do = Create a ValueSet for AgeGroupObservationValue (urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.11.75)

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.clinicalFocus
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = Clinical concepts addressed
  Definition = The clinical concept(s) addressed by the artifact.  For example, disease, diagnostic test interpretation, medication ordering. Please refer to the implementation guide on which code system and codes to use

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.targetUser
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = Target user type
  Definition = The user types to which an artifact is targeted.  For example, PCP, Patient, Cardiologist, Behavioral Professional, Oral Health Professional, Prescriber, etc... taken from the NUCC Health Care provider taxonomyCode system (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.6.101)

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.workflowSetting
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = Workflow setting
  Definition = The settings in which the artifact is intended for use.  For example, admission, pre-op, etc

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.workflowTask
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = Clinical task context
  Definition = The context for the clinical task(s) represented by this artifact. Can be any task context represented by the HL7 ActTaskCode value set (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19846). General categories include: order entry, patient documentation and patient information review
  To Do = Create a ValueSet for ActTaskCode (urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19846)

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = UsageContext.clinicalVenue
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = ActEncounterCode
  Short Label = Applicable venue
  Definition = The venue in which an artifact could be used.  For example, Outpatient, Inpatient, Home, Nursing home. The code value may originate from either the HL7 ActEncounter (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.13955) or NUCC non-individual provider codes OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19465
