
=== Sheet Bindings =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = RelatedResourceType
  Binding = code list
  Reference = #related-resource-type
  Definition = The type of related resource for the module
  Conformance = required

=== Sheet related-resource-type =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = documentation
  Display = Documentation
  Definition = Additional documentation for the module. This would include additional instructions on usage as well additional information on clinical context or appropriateness

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Id = 2
  Code = justification
  Display = Justification
  Definition = A summary of the justification for the artifact including supporting evidence, relevant guidelines, or other clinically important information. This information is intended to provide a way to make the justification for the module available to the consumer of interventions or results produced by the artifact

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Id = 3
  Code = citation
  Display = Citation
  Definition = Bibliographic citation for papers, references, or other relevant material for the module. This is intended to allow for citation of related material, but that was not necessarily specifically prepared in connection with this module

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Id = 4
  Code = predecessor
  Display = Predecessor
  Definition = The previous version of the module

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Id = 5
  Code = successor
  Display = Successor
  Definition = The next version of the module

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Id = 6
  Code = derived-from
  Display = Derived From
  Definition = The module is derived from the resource. This is intended to capture the relationship when a particular module is based on the content of another module, but is modified to capture either a different set of overall requirements, or a more specific set of requirements such as those involved in a particular institution or clinical setting

=== Sheet Invariants =====================================

=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedResource
  Type = Structure
  Short Label = Related resources for the module
  Definition = Related resources such as additional documentation, justification, or bibliographic references
  Requirements = Modules must be able to provide enough information for consumers of the content (and/or interventions or results produced by the content) to be able to determine and understand the justification for and evidence in support of the content
  Comments = Each related resource is either an attachment, or a reference to another resource, but not both
  Committee Notes = This data type was defined to support reuse of the pattern of contributor elements across multiple conformance and knowledge asset resources

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedResource.type
  Card. = 1..1
  Type = code
  Binding = RelatedResourceType
  Short Label = documentation | justification | citation | predecessor | successor | derived-from
  Definition = The type of related resource

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedResource.document
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Attachment
  Short Label = The related document
  Definition = The document being referenced, represented as an attachment. This is exclusive with the resource element

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = RelatedResource.resource
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Any)
  Short Label = The related resource
  Definition = The related resource, such as a library, value set, profile, or other module
  Comments = If the type is predecessor, this is a reference to the succeeding module. If the type is successor, this is a reference to the prior module
