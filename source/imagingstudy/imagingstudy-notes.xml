<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
A referenced DICOM SOP instance could be: 
<ul>
<li>A single- or multi-frame, still or video image captured by a variety of imaging modalities, such as X-ray, MR, and ultrasound;</li>
<li>A set of various presentation parameters, including annotation and markup;</li>
<li>A set of measurements or a report, including radiation dose report and CAD analysis;</li>
<li>An encapsulated PDF or CDA document;</li>
<li>A list of instances, such as key “of interest” images, or instances to be “deleted”; or </li>
<li>Other DICOM content. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
UID values follow the FHIR convention of expressing UIDs as URNs. For example, the DICOM Study Instance UID 
of <code>1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910</code> is expressed as <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910”</code>. 
</p>
<p>  
ImagingStudy.baseLocation and ImagingStudy.series.baseLocation can each list multiple methods to retrieve 
the study, series or instances. If a study-level <a href="imagingmanifest.html#baseLocation">baseLocation</a> of a particular 
type is present, it shall be applicable to all listed series and instances in the study, unless overridden by a 
series-level <a href="imagingmanifest.html#baseLocation">baseLocation</a> of that type. (Series-level 
locations can be provided because all series of a study are not guaranteed to be on the same server. For the identified 
retrieval mechanisms, the services supporting instance-level retrieval do not differ from the series-level services, 
thus instance-level baseLocation is not defined.) 
</p>
<p>
The form, requirements, and necessary manipulation of the baseLocation.url depend on service identified in baseLocation.type:

<h3>Use Case</h3>
<h4>EHR access to imaging studies</h4>
<p>
Amy, a family physician, would like to see a list of available studies for her patient, Alex. Her EHR 
client makes a FHIR call for all <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> objects available for Alex. 
In the response, she is able to see the study date, procedure, modality, and accession number, for each 
study returned. There is enough information provided in the response to obtain a thumbnail via a WADO-RS 
call, or to launch a viewer using an <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology - Invoke Image Display (IID)</a> 
profile call using the url elements found in the <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a>.
</p>
<h4>Comprehensive Imaging Scheduled Workflow</h4>
<p>
Joe Angina complains of shortness of breath and occasional chest pain to his primary care physician, Dr. Pat Down at 
Local MultiClinic, who orders a stress echocardiogram; the order is created as a FHIR <a href="task.html">Task</a> 
resource to manage the workflow, with a link to a <a href="diagnosticrequest.html">DiagnosticRequest</a> resource with 
the details of the request.   The order is scheduled and assigned to cardiologist Dr. Art Skann, also at Local MultiClinic.   
</p>
<p>
On the scheduled day of the exam, Joe arrives at the echo lab to meet with Dr. Skann and have the study done.  
Dr. Skann’s workstation shows the daily list of <a href="task.html">Task</a>, and he follows the link to retrieve the 
<a href="diagnosticrequest.html">DiagnosticRequest</a>. (He may follow the links through the 
referenced <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource to access Joe’s electronic 
medical record, but that is not the concern of this storyboard.)  
</p>
<p>
The <a href="task.html">Task</a> and <a href="diagnosticrequest.html">DiagnosticRequest</a> has been transcoded to a DICOM Modality Worklist 
Scheduled Procedure Step, and in the echo lab the equipment has downloaded the Modality Worklist.  The 
study is performed, and the acquired images and sonographer’s preliminary measurements are stored in the 
Local MultiClinic Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).  The PACS creates 
an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource for each study it manages.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Skann interprets the study on a PACS workstation, and he selects two key image frames to be included 
in the diagnostic report; this selection is stored back to the PACS as a DICOM Key Object Selection with 
the title "For Report Attachment", and the PACS makes it available (transcodes it) as a 
FHIR <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource.  Dr. Skann dictates the 
report using a structured data entry report writing program, including a recommendation for a cardiac 
catheterization procedure, and signs it.  The report writing program formats the report 
as a <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> document, 
retrieves the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource, and inserts the 
referenced key images into the report.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Down meets again with Joe, and they review the results of the stress test.  Joe has a question about 
the findings that the key images in the report do not show, so Dr. Down uses the Local MultiClinic EMR 
to query the PACS for the full <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource, and uses the references there to open an image 
display for the full study.  Joe agrees to proceed to catheterization, and Dr. Down sends a referral to 
the Ginormous University Hospital cath department, and triggers the PACS to share the echo study 
through the Metropolitan Health Information Exchange.  
</p>
<p>
The PACS creates a manifest of the study as an <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> 
resource, which includes all the 
images but excludes the sonographer’s preliminary measurements (which as a matter of policy are 
not shared outside the Local MultiClinic). The manifest is published to the Metro HIE. (In 
accordance with <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE XDS-I</a>, the images themselves are not directly 
published to the HIE, but available for on-demand retrieval from the PACS.)
</p>
<p>
At Ginormous Hospital, Dr. Cora Plummer receives the cath referral, and looks up the study in the 
Metro HIE registry.  She retrieves the study manifest <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>, 
and uses it to access the shared images, which she uses to prepare for the cath procedure.
</p>


<!-- old use-case replaced August 2015, CP #7679
<p>
The following storyboard illustrates the primary use case for 
this resource:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An oncologist, Karen, is seeing patients in her clinic, and would like
background on the patients she is seeing today. Her first patient of the
day, Alex. has arrived. She launches her Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
software, and makes a Patient query on Alex using his last name. The EMR
software makes a FHIR query on the Patient resource, to provide background
demographic information for cover page rendering. The EMR software makes a
subsequent FHIR query on the Condition resource, and reports that Alex is
suspected to have prostate cancer. With this information, Karen decides to
check for two further tests - the results of a Prostate-Specific Antigen
(PSA) laboratory test, and of a CT exam performed at the local diagnostic
facility. First, a FHIR query is made against the Observation resource to
query for the most recent value of PSA (the EMR also queries previous 
values of PSA for trending). For the CT exam, the EMR software queries on
the ImagingStudy resource to retrieve a list of available images with other 
relevant constraints (such as modality, body region etc.). This returns 
back the studies available, with relevant meta-data about each study,
its series and images. This information will help Karen to select which 
study would like to review. Using the WADO-RS references provided, the 
artifacts Karen would like to review can be downloaded and viewed using 
capable DICOM viewing software.
