Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn\'t imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.

  Comments = This attribute will most often NOT be populated.  It is most commonly used for injections.  For example, Slow Push, Deep IV.  One of the reasons this attribute is not used often, is that the method is often pre-coordinated with the route and/or form of administration.  This means the codes used in route or form may pre-coordinate the method in the route code or the form code.  The implementation decision about what coding system to use for route or form code will determine how frequently the method code will be populated e.g. if route or form code pre-coordinate method code, then this attribute will not be populated often; if there is no pre-coordination then method code may  be used frequently.

  Comments = Note that this specifies the quantity of the specified medication, not the quantity of active ingredient(s).  The prescribed strength can be calculated by multiplying the doseQuantity by the strength of each active ingredient in the prescribed Medication. If the administration is not intended to be instantaneous (rate is present or timing has a duration), this can be specified to convey the total amount to be administered over the period of time as indicated by the schedule.

May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.  Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn\'t imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.
