<h2>Clinical Reasoning</h2>

<p><i>This draft of the CQF IG is being balloted as FHIR-Based Clinical Quality Framework (CQF-on-FHIR) as an STU ballot for the September 2016 ballot cycle. In addition, this guidance will be used to support the CQF-on-FHIR and Payer Extract tracks in the September 2016 FHIR connect-a-thon.</i></p>

<p><i>The guidance in this module is prepared as a Universal Realm Specification with support from the <a href="http://cqframework.info">Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) initiative</a>, which is a public-private partnership sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to identify, develop, and harmonize standards for clinical decision support and electronic clinical quality measurement.</i></p>

<a name="intro"> </a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Clinical Reasoning module provides resources and operations to enable the representation, distribution, and evaluation of clinical knowledge artifacts such as clinical decision support rules, quality measures, order sets, and protocols. In addition, the module describes how expression languages can be used throughout the specification to provide dynamic capabilities.</p>

<p>Clinical Reasoning involves the ability to represent and encode clinical knowledge in a very broad sense so that it can be integrated into clinical systems. This encoding may be as simple as controlling whether or not a particular section of an order set appears based on the specific conditions that are present for the patient in content in a CPOE system, or it may be as complex as representing the care pathway for patients with multiple conditions.</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>
<p>The Clinical Reasoning module focuses on enabling two primary use cases:</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>Sharing</b> - The ability to represent clinical knowledge artifacts such as decision support rules, order sets, protocols, and quality measures, and to do so in a way that enables those artifacts to be shared across organizations and institutions.</li>
	<li><b>Evaluation</b> - The ability to evaluate clinical knowledge artifacts in the context of a specific patient or population, including the ability to request decision support guidance, impact clinical workflow, and retrospectively assess quality metrics.</li>
</ol>

<p>To enable these use cases, the module defines several components that can each be used independently, or combined to enable more complex functionality. These components are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Expression Logic</b> - The ability to represent expression logic using languages such as FluentPath and Clinical Quality Language (CQL).</li>
	<li><b>Definitional Resources</b> - The ability to describe definitional resources, or <i>template</i> resources that are not defined on any specific patient, but are used to define the actions to be performed as part of a clinical knowledge artifact such as an order set or decision support rule.</li>
	<li><b>Knowledge Artifacts</b> - The ability to represent clinical knowledge artifacts such as decision support rules and clinical quality measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>These basic components can then be used to enable a broad variety of clinical decision support and quality measurement use cases, including knowledge sharing, decision support services, and clinical quality assessment and reporting. The topics below provide more detailed discussion on each of these components and uses:</p>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>

<p>Because Knowledge Artifacts are typically patient-independent, many of the resources in the clinical reasoning module have no patient security and privacy concerns beyond the normal sensitivity that should be paid in any electronic healthcare system environment. However, the evaluation use case, including decision support guidance request/response, as well as quality measure evaluation have significant patient security and privacy concerns.</p>

<p>For the clinical decision support evaluation use case, as with any patient-specific information, care should be taken to ensure that the request and response are properly secured both at rest and in-motion, and that all access to the patient's information is done via a properly authenticated and authorized mechanism. This is particularly true of decision support artifacts where the logic is ingested as part of the definition of the artifact. In this scenario, the evaluation engine must ensure that data access within the ingested logic is subject to the same authentication and authorization requirements as any other access.</p>

<p>For guidance services that receive patient information, ensure that logging and auditing trails do not inadvertently compromise patient privacy and security by logging potentially sensitive information in an unencrypted way. In addition, guidance and recommendations returned from the service must ensure that content that contains patient information is clearly indicated so that consuming clients can take the appropriate care in integrating and displaying the resulting guidance.</p>

<p>For quality measure evaluation, individual and patient-list reports have the potential to contain large amounts of patient information. As with the decision support guidance responses, care must be taken to ensure the patient information is only accessible to properly authenticated and authorized agents, and that inadvertent breaches are minimized by following appropriate logging and auditing protocols.</p>

<p>For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.</p>

<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>

<p>The resources defined for the Clinical Reasoning module are the result of the combined efforts of multiple communities working on the shared goal of harmonized standards and specifications for clinical decision support and quality measurement artifacts. The current state of the module reflects changes incorporated both from previous ballots on the FHIR-specific material, as well as content derived from several other balloted specifications in the CDS and CQM domains. The content at this point is capable of supporting the two primary use cases of sharing and evaluation in both domains and for a fairly broad variety of artifacts.</p>

<p>The goals of the module over the next year are to provide a stable basis for implementation of the sharing and evaluation use cases. The Clinical Quality Framework Initiative will use these resources as the basis for implementation projects, targeting an FMM level of 3 or 4 for all module resources within a year. We are actively seeking comments on all areas of the module, with particular focus on supporting the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The use of FluentPath and CQL to provide dynamic functionality throughout FHIR</li>
	<li>FHIR-Based Knowledge Artifact Repository</li>
	<li>FHIR-Based Clinical Decision Support Service</li>
	<li>FHIR-Based Quality Measure Evaluation and Reporting</li>
	<li>FHIR-Based Order Set Catalog/Ordering Services</li>
	<li>The use of FHIR operations as the protocol for defining artifact evaluation requests and responses. In particular, the ability to bundle multiple requests into a single operation, as well as the use of a generic FHIR operation for any module evaluation, versus defining an evaluation specific to a given knowledge module.</li>
	<li>The use of FHIR interactions in general as a mechanism for enabling knowledge module repository and distribution functionality.</li>
</ul>

<a name="background"/>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The CQF Implementation Guide is sponsored by the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Information (CQI) HL7 Work Groups, with input and coordination from the FHIR Infrastructure and Service Oriented Architecture HL7 Work Groups.</p>

<p>The Clinical Quality Framework initiative has focused on harmonizing the historically disjointed specifications used by the Clinical Quality Measurement and Clinical Decision Support communities. Specifically, the initiative has focused on the specifications used to represent knowledge artifacts within the two communities. The strategy employed has been to break the conceptual content of knowledge artifacts into three core components, to define common standards for these core components, and to re-use these common standards for both clinical decision support and clinical quality measurement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Metadata - Descriptive information about the artifact and its content</li>
	<li>Clinical Information - The representation used to represent clinical information about the patient or population of concern within a given artifact</li>
	<li>Logic - The representation used to convey the logic involved in the artifact</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Clinical Quality Framework Conceptual Components" src="cqframework-components-diagram.jpg"/>

<p>The first component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=391">Clinical Quality Common Metadata Conceptual Model</a>, an informative document harmonizing metadata requirements between Quality Measurement and Decision Support artifacts.</p>

<p>The second component has resulted in the QUICK <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=378">Conceptual</a> and Logical Models, a harmonization of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=338">Virtual Medical Record (vMR)</a> used in Decision Support and the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">Quality Data Model (QDM)</a> used in Quality Measurement, and realized in FHIR as the QICore profiles.</p>

<p>And finally, the third component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=400">Clinical Quality Language Specification</a>, a harmonization of the expressive capabilities of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=337">Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification (CDS KAS)</a> (produced by the <a href="http://healthedecisions.org">Health eDecisions</a> (HeD) S&amp;I Framework Initiative), and the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=97">Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF)</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the ongoing CQF initiative pilot efforts, these developing specifications are being used to support knowledge artifact sharing, as well as evaluation of knowledge artifacts as part of decision support request/response and measure evaluation.</p>

<p>This implementation guide continues the harmonization of quality domain specifications by defining an approach to using a FHIR server as a component of a knowledge system in both the Knowledge Repository and Knowledge Evaluation Service roles.</p>
