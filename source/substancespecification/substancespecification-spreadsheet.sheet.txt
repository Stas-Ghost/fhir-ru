These sources could be regulatory submissions, publications by naming authorities such as INN or USAN, pharmacopoeias, books, journals, web sites, meeting materials of public databases such as chemical abstracts. A source can refer to multiple data elements and a given element can have multiple sources

 -- Row 92 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = 552;144
  Type = Backbone Element
  Short Name = Although ISO 11238 does not provide any guidance on substance nomenclature, it does provide a structure for the capture of names and codes that are used to refer to a substance. For the purpose of ISO 11238 there are basically eleven types of names, Official names, systematic names, other names, brand names, company codes, homeopathic names, specified homeopathic names, plasma-derived names, specified substance group 1,2 and 3 names

 -- Row 93 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.substanceName
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Name = The Name or company code associated with the Substance shall be specified. For substances originated from Plants the Substance is always a single species, or infraspecies, or is occasionally a single genus. It will have a Name which is composed of: [Scientific genus/binomial/trinomial with Author] [Part(s)] The scientific element of the name is usually a binomial, but may be a trinomial or a genus, as appropriate, together with the author of the name. The Name is not an official name in any pharmacopoeia or other legislation, and the inclusion of the author is to ensure that it is not confused with the official names for specified substances that are derived from a single species substance. It can be written in any language and its jurisdiction can be restricted using Name Status

  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.substanceNameType
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Name = Each name shall be associated with a type

 -- Row 95 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.language
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Name = The language used to provide the structured substance information shall be specified according to the XML standard’s xml:lang attribute specification, which is based on ISO 639-1, alpha-2 code

 -- Row 96 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.substanceNameDomain
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Name = Specifies when and for what purpose the name is to be used. All substance names can have at least one domain. This is useful to differentiate different names for the same substance as used for a drug active ingredient as opposed to a food colour additive

 -- Row 97 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.jurisdiction
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Name = The jurisdiction of the official name shall be provided

 -- Row 98 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.officialName
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = 267;163
  Type = Backbone Element
  Short Name = Each official name shall have one or more official name types. The official name type reflects the organisation that assigns or recognises the name associated with the substance. These names are typically non-proprietary names that are used in the labelling of pharmaceuticals. The domains and jurisdictions in which the official name is used are also captured, tracked and maintained within the terminology. Although most official names will refer to material at the substance level there will be instances where an official name will refer to material at the Specified Substances Group 1 level [ . Simeticone (BAN, INN) or Simethicone (USAN)]. The official name class is optional and shall be repeated as necessary

 -- Row 99 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.officialName.officialNameType
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Name = Designation of which authority assigned the Official Name of the Substance. All official names need to have at least one such designation. The name type is the name of the authority or authorities that have assigned or have adopted the name

 -- Row 100 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.officialName.officialNameStatus
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Name = The status of the official name

 -- Row 101 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.officialName.officialNameStatusChangeDate
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = Date of official name change if known

 -- Row 102 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.substanceName.referenceSource
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = @SubstanceSpecification.referenceInformation.substanceClassification.referenceSource
  Short Name = All data elements associated with a Substance or Specified Substance should have a reference source. These sources could be regulatory submissions, publications by naming authorities such as INN or USAN, pharmacopoeias, books, journals, web sites, meeting materials of public databases such as chemical abstracts. A source can refer to multiple data elements and a given element can have multiple sources

 -- Row 103 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.version
  Card. = 0..*
  UML = 398;550
  Type = Backbone Element
  Short Name = This subclause shall provide information on the version of the substance. Where no “Version Number” and “Effective Date” have been assigned by an authority source, the version number shall be set as 0 with the date set as the date of initial submission of the substance. Any changes or updates to a given substance will result in a new version. This could include changes in the definition of the substance or the addition of names, codes. The version of substances should be tracked. Submitters should also indicate if it is a new version of a previous submission

 -- Row 104 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.version.versionNumber
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = integer
  Short Name = The number of the version of the substance shall be provided

 -- Row 105 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.version.effectiveDate
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Name = The date when the substance was effective should be provided in line with the ISO 8601 date format. This shall be defined when the substance is generated or modified

 -- Row 106 -----------------------------------
  Element = SubstanceSpecification.version.changeMade
  Card. = 0..1
