<h2>Defined RESTful API Operations</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http.html">RESTful API</a> defines a set of common interactions (read, update, search, etc.)
performed on a repository of typed resources. For further information concerning how operations are 
defined and invoked, see <a href="operations">Extended Operations on the RESTful API</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a full list of the operations defined by this specification:

Notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>The special operations on the <code>meta</code> element also operate on previous versions of a resource (/_history/).  They are the only operations that can manipulate versions other than the "current" version.</li>
 <li>Implementation Guides can define additional operations</li>
</ul>
