<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<p>
A referenced DICOM SOP instance could be: 
<ul>
<li>A single- or multi-frame, still or video image captured by a variety of imaging modalities, such as X-ray, MR, and ultrasound;</li>
<li>A set of various presentation parameters, including annotation and markup;</li>
<li>A set of measurements or a report, including radiation dose report and CAD analysis;</li>
<li>An encapsulated PDF or CDA document;</li>
<li>A list of instances, such as key “of interest” images, or instances to be “deleted”; or </li>
<li>Other DICOM content. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
UID values follow the FHIR convention of expressing UIDs as URNs. For example, the DICOM Study Instance UID 
of <code>1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910</code> is expressed as <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910”</code>. 
</p>
<p>  
ImagingManifest.study.baseLocation and ImagingManifest.study.series.baseLocation can each list multiple methods to retrieve 
the study, series or instances. If a study-level baseLocation of a particular type is present, it shall be applicable to all 
listed series and instances in the study, unless overridden by a series-level baseLocation of that type. (Series-level 
locations can be provided because all series of a study are not guaranteed to be on the same server. For the identified 
retrieval mechanisms, the services supporting instance-level retrieval do not differ from the series-level services, 
thus instance-level baseLocation is not defined.) 
</p>
<p>
The form, requirements, and necessary manipulation of the baseLocation.url depend on service identified in baseLocation.type:
</p>
<h4>WADO-URI</h4>
<p>
WADO-URI: baseLocation.url shall contain the scheme, authority, and path. Neither the question mark (“?”) nor any  query 
parameters shall be included.
</p>
<p>
The DICOM WADO-URI (Web Access to DICOM Objects, URI mode) service uses HTTP query parameter syntax. This service allows 
for retrieval of native DICOM instances, or instances “rendered” into other formats, including JPEG and MPEG. The media 
type of a response is specified by the request Accept header (preferred); or, by the contentType query parameter. 
Supported media types depend on the classification of the instance as “single frame,” “multi-frame,” “video,” “text,” or “other.” 
</p>
<p>
The query to retrieve a DICOM instance is constructed by appending the appropriate query parameters to the baseLocation.url. 
</p>
<p>
For example, a native DICOM PS3.10 instance file can be retrieved (if consistent with the Accept header) by performing 
a GET on a URL constructed from a baseLocation.url of <code>“https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-uri”</code>, the study.uid value 
of <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910”</code>, study.series.uid value 
of <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.789001276.14556172.67789”</code>, and study.series.instance.uid value 
of <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.2678810.87991027.899772.2”</code>:
</p>
<pre>

https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-uri?requestType=WADO&amp;studyUID=1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910&amp;seriesUID=1.2.250.1.59.40211.789001276.14556172.67789&amp;objectUID=1.2.250.1.59.40211.2678810.87991027.899772.2

</pre>

<p>
Additional query parameters can control other aspects of the rendering including rendered dimensions, quality (compression 
ratio), the region of interest within the image to render, brightness/contrast (window center/width) adjustments, whether 
to “burn” patient or study demographics into the rendered result, and which frame of a multi-frame instance to retrieve. 
</p>
<p>
For example, provided the Accept header indicates a preference for image/jpeg, the example above can be extended with 
parameters that cause a JPEG thumbnail (100 columns by 100 rows) of the left half of the image to be retrieved (additional 
parameters emphasized):

</p>
<h4>WADO-RS</h4>
<p>
WADO-RS: baseLocation.url shall contain the scheme, authority, and path of the service. Sub-services, such as study, 
shall not be specified. The path shall not contain a trailing slash.
</p>
<p>
The DICOM WADO-RS (Web Access to DICOM Objects, RESTful mode) service uses a RESTful approach to instance retrieval. 
This service allows for retrieval of native DICOM SOP instances, or instances “rendered” into other formats, including 
JPEG and MPEG. The media type of a response is specified by the request Accept header (preferred); or, by the accept 
query parameters. Supported media types depend on the classification of the instance 
as “single frame,” “multi-frame,” “video,” “text,” or “other.” The WADO-RS service also allows retrieval of study 
or series level information.
</p>
<p>
The query to retrieve a DICOM instance is constructed by appending the appropriate sub-resource paths to baseLocation.url. 
</p>
<p>
For example, a native DICOM PS3.10 instance file can be retrieved (if consistent with the Accept header) by 
performing a GET on a URL constructed from a baseLocation.url of <code>“https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-rs”</code>, the 
study.uid value 
of <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910”</code>, study.series.uid value 
of <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.789001276.14556172.67789”</code>, and study.series.instance.uid value 
of <code>“urn:oid:1.2.250.1.59.40211.2678810.87991027.899772.2”</code>:
</p>
<pre>

https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-rs/studies/1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910/series/1.2.250.1.59.40211.789001276.14556172.67789/instances/1.2.250.1.59.40211.2678810.87991027.899772.2

</pre>
<p>
Query parameters on the "rendered" sub-resource can control other aspects of the rendering including: the rendered dimensions, the 
quality (compression ratio), the region of interest to render, the brightness/contrast (window center/width) 
adjustments, and whether to “burn” patient or study demographics into the rendered result. Specific frames 
of a multi-frame instance may be retrieved using the frames sub-resource. 
</p>
<p>
For example, provided the Accept header indicates a preference for image/jpeg, the example above can be 
extended with parameters that cause a JPEG thumbnail (100 columns by 100 rows) of a region extending from 
the top-left corner of the original image, across 1000 and down 3000 pixels, to be retrieved (additional 
sub-resource and parameters emphasized):
</p>
<pre>

https://pacs.hospital.org/wado-rs/studies/1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910/series/1.2.250.1.59.40211.789001276.14556172.67789/instances/1.2.250.1.59.40211.2678810.87991027.899772.2<b>/rendered?viewport=100,100,0,0,1000,3000</b>

</p>
<h4>IID</h4>
<p>
IID: baseLocation.url shall contain the scheme, authority, and path. Neither the question mark (“?”) nor any query 
parameters shall be included.
</p>
<p>
The IHE Invoke Image Display (IID) service provides a standardized mechanism to launch a viewer in a particular 
study context. (IID also supports invoking a particular patient context, but that is not profiled here.) 
An IID baseLocation.type should be used only at the study level. 
As well invoking the viewer on a particular study, query parameters can request particular viewer capabilities, 
image quality, and more.
</p>
<p>
To launch a viewer, append the appropriate query parameters to baseLocation.url. 
</p>
<p>
For example, given a baseLocation.url of <code>https://pacs.hospital.org/IHEInvokeImageDisplay</code>, to invoke a 
diagnostic quality viewer on the study with study.uid value 
of <code>“urn:uri:1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910”</code>, the following URL would be constructed:
</p>
<pre>

https://pacs.hospital.org/IHEInvokeImageDisplay?requestType=STUDY&amp;studyUID=1.2.250.1.59.40211.12345678.678910&amp;diagnosticQuality=true

</pre>

<h3>Use Case</h3>
<h4>EHR access to imaging studies</h4>
<p>
Amy, a family physician, is accessing a cross-enterprise document registry that contains 
radiology objects (<a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology XDS-I</a>), to discover studies for her patient, Alex. 
Her EHR client makes a FHIR call for all <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> objects available for 
Alex. In the response, she is able to get study identifiers for each study that has 
been published to the registry. 
There is enough information provided in the response to obtain a thumbnail via a WADO-RS 
call, or to launch a viewer using an <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE Radiology - Invoke Image Display (IID)</a> 
profile call using the url elements found in the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>.
In each result, there is a reference to 
the <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> FHIR object which can provide more information about each study.
</p>
<h4>Comprehensive Imaging Scheduled Workflow</h4>
<p>
Joe Angina complains of shortness of breath and occasional chest pain to his primary care physician, Dr. Pat Down at 
Local MultiClinic, who orders a stress echocardiogram; the order is created as a FHIR <a href="order.html">Order</a> 
resource to manage the workflow, with a link to a <a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a> resource with 
the details of the request.   The order is scheduled and assigned to cardiologist Dr. Art Skann, also at Local MultiClinic.   
</p>
<p>
On the scheduled day of the exam, Joe arrives at the echo lab to meet with Dr. Skann and have the study done.  
Dr. Skann’s workstation shows the daily list of <a href="order.html">Order</a>, and he follows the link to retrieve the 
<a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a>. (He may follow the links through the 
referenced <a href="patient.html">Patient</a> resource to access Joe’s electronic 
medical record, but that is not the concern of this storyboard.)  
</p>
<p>
The <a href="order.html">Order</a> and <a href="diagnosticorder.html">DiagnosticOrder</a> has been transcoded to a DICOM Modality Worklist 
Scheduled Procedure Step, and in the echo lab the equipment has downloaded the Modality Worklist.  The 
study is performed, and the acquired images and sonographer’s preliminary measurements are stored in the 
Local MultiClinic Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).  The PACS creates 
an <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource for each study it manages.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Skann interprets the study on a PACS workstation, and he selects two key image frames to be included 
in the diagnostic report; this selection is stored back to the PACS as a DICOM Key Object Selection with 
the title "For Report Attachment", and the PACS makes it available (transcodes it) as a 
FHIR <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource.  Dr. Skann dictates the 
report using a structured data entry report writing program, including a recommendation for a cardiac 
catheterization procedure, and signs it.  The report writing program formats the report 
as a <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=7">CDA</a> document, 
retrieves the <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> resource, and inserts the 
referenced key images into the report.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Down meets again with Joe, and they review the results of the stress test.  Joe has a question about 
the findings that the key images in the report do not show, so Dr. Down uses the Local MultiClinic EMR 
to query the PACS for the full <a href="imagingstudy.html">ImagingStudy</a> resource, and uses the references there to open an image 
display for the full study.  Joe agrees to proceed to catheterization, and Dr. Down sends a referral to 
the Ginormous University Hospital cath department, and triggers the PACS to share the echo study 
through the Metropolitan Health Information Exchange.  
</p>
<p>
The PACS creates a manifest of the study as an <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a> 
resource, which includes all the 
images but excludes the sonographer’s preliminary measurements (which as a matter of policy are 
not shared outside the Local MultiClinic). The manifest is published to the Metro HIE. (In 
accordance with <a href="http://www.ihe.net">IHE XDS-I</a>, the images themselves are not directly 
published to the HIE, but available for on-demand retrieval from the PACS.)
</p>
<p>
At Ginormous Hospital, Dr. Cora Plummer receives the cath referral, and looks up the study in the 
Metro HIE registry.  She retrieves the study manifest <a href="imagingmanifest.html">ImagingManifest</a>, 
and uses it to access the shared images, which she uses to prepare for the cath procedure.
