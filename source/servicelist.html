<h2>Services Defined by the FHIR specification</h2>

<p>
This page lists all the services defined by FHIR. 
Services are business level aggregations of <a href="resourcelist.html">Resources</a>
and <a href="operationslist.html">Operations</a> to provide a defined package of 
services that correspond to an identified business need.
</p>
<p>
Note that in addition to the services defined in this specification, many 
<a href="http://fhir.org/implementation_guides">implementation guides</a>
define business level services.

  <td><a href="terminology-service.html">Terminology Service</a></td>
  <td><p>A service that lets healthcare applications make use of codes, code systems, and value sets without having to become
experts in the fine details of the code system, value set and concept map resources, and the underlying 
code systems and terminological principles. The service provides the following functionality: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Defining and managing code systems, value sets, and concept maps</li>
 <li>Code lookup &amp; Validation</li>
 <li>Value Set Expansion (including for UI data entry support)</li>
 <li>Value Set Validation</li>
 <li>Translations between code systems</li>
 <li>Subsumption testing and other logical analyses</li>
 <li>Maintaining a closure table</li>

 <tr>
  <td>Conformance Service</td>
  <td><p>A service that provides the underlying services needed to test whether resources conform to the rules 
  defined by the FHIR specification and applicable implementation guides, and to help author implementation guides. The service provides the following functionality: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Defining and managing structure definitions, data elements, conformance statements, search parameters, and operation &amp; compartment definitions</li>
 <li>Resource Validation</li>
 <li>Comparing and subsetting conformance statements</li>
</ul>

<p>
Possible candidate Business Services for future versions:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Conversion Service (using mapping language, and also iso-semantic transforms in a resource)</li>
 <li>Questionnaire related finctionality (though see SDC)</li>
 <li>Patient Registration &amp; Reconciliation service (per IXS)</li>
 <li>Medication Management service (home specific variant?)</li>
 <li>Clinical Data Repository</li>
 <li>Clinical Task Manager</li>
 <li>Comminications Manager</li>
 <li>...?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that there is already past &amp; current work on some of these in HL7 (though not necessarily FHIR specific).
