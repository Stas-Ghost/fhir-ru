<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
The FHIR terminology specification is based two key concepts, originally defined in <a href="http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/standards/V3/core_principles/infrastructure/coreprinciples/v3modelcoreprinciples.html">HL7 v3 Core Principles</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>code system</b> - defines a set of codes with meanings (also known as enumeration, terminology, classification, and/or ontology)</li>
<li> <b>value set</b> - selects a set of codes from those defined by one or more code systems</li>
</ul>
<p>
Code systems define which codes (symbols and/or expressions) exist, and how they are understood. Value Sets 
select a set of codes from one or more code systems to specify which codes can be used in a particular context.
</p>
<p>
The Code system resource is used to declare the existence of a code system, and it's key properties:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Identifying URL and version</li>
 <li>Description, Copyright, publication date, and other metadata</li>
 <li>Some key properties of the code system itself - whether it's case sensitive, version safe, and whether it defines a compositional grammar</li>
 <li>What filters can be used in value sets that use the code system in a ValueSet.compose element</li> 
 <li>What properties the concepts defined by the code system</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the code system resource may list some or all of the concepts in the code system, along with
their basic properties (code, display, definition), designations, and additional properties.
</p>
<p>
The Code system resource is not intended to support the process of maintaining a 
code system. Instead, the focus is on publishing the properties and optionally 
the content of a code system for use throughout the FHIR eco-system. Note that 
the important existing (large) code systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD family, etc) 
all have their own distribution formats, and there is no intent that the code system
resource be used for distributing these kind of terminologies. Instead, it is 
intended to be used for distributing the smaller ad-hoc code systems that are 
ubiqutiously encountered through out the healthcare process.

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Code systems are used in <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a> resources</li>
 <li>The <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> data type refers to code system resources by their canonical URL</li>
 <li>The CodeSystem resource design is based on the functionality described in the <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CTS2/1.0/">OMG CTS 2</a> specification, along 
 with metadata in the HL7 Code System Definition specification. Code system resources can be converted to CTS2 
 code system and code system resources.</li>
 <li>The code system resource is aligned with the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Value_Set_Definition_Standard_Project">Code System Definition</a> (VSD) project. 
 Not all of the elements defined by the VSD are part of the base resource - some are defined as part of the <a href="valueset-extensions.html">CodeSystem Extensions</a>.
 In the CodeSystem resource, the <code>lockedDate</code>, <code>compose</code> and <code>codeSystem</code> elements make up the VSD Content Logical definition.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background and Context</h2>

<p>
When using code systems and value sets, proper differentiation between a code system and a value set is important. 
This is one very common area where significant clinical safety risks occur in practice. Implementers
should be familiar with the content in <a href="terminologies.html">Using Codes in resources</a>.
</p>
<p>
Each code system has 2 different URLs that can be used to reference it - its logical identifier, and 
its location.
</p>
<p>
The location of the code system is a URL by which it may be retrieved, usually from a FHIR 
server, and may be a relative reference to a code system on the same server. 
The logical identifier is in the code system itself, in 
<a href="codesystem-definitions.html#CodeSystem.url">CodeSystem.url</a>. This 
is the logical identity (sometimes called the canonical URL) that refers to this 
code system across all systems. Ideally, the URL should also be the location of the 
master version of the code system, though this is not always possible. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For example, the code systems published as part of FHIR all have a logical URL
which is also a location by which they may be accessed in the FHIR specification
itself. However, while a new version of the FHIR Specification is being prepared,
code systems that are published in the drafts will not be found in the current FHIR
specification. 
</p>
<p>
Because it is common practice to copy (cache) code systems locally, most 
references to code systems can be either a logical or a literal URL. 
</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>CodeSystem Identification</h3>
<p>
A code system has 3 identifiers:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>CodeSystem.id: the local identifier on the system that holds it - this changes as it moves from server to server (this id, with the server address prepended, is called the 'literal identity' of the resource)</li>
 <li>CodeSystem.url: the master identifier that never changes for this code system - it is the same in every copy (this is called the 'logical identity' of the resource)</li>
 <li>CodeSystem.identifier: A system/value pair that is used to identify the code system in other contexts (such as an OID in an <a href="https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=186">HL7 v3</a> specification)</li>
</ul>
