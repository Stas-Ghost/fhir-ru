Comments: Indirect characteristics may be those of a specimen, fetus, donor,  other observer (for example a relative or EMT), or any observation made about the subject.
  Requirements = Observations have no value if you don\'t know who or what they\'re about.
  Comments = One would expect this element to be a cardinality  of 1..1.  The only circumstance in which the subject can be missing is when the observation is made by a device that does not know the patient. In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated.\r\rIf the target of the observation is different than the subject, the general extension [observation-focal-subject](extension-observation-focal-subject.html).  may be used.  However, the distinction between the patient\'s own value for an observation versus that of the fetus, or the donor or blood product unit, etc., are often specified in the observation code.

  Type = Quantity|CodeableConcept|string|Range|Ratio|SampledData|Attachment|time|dateTime|Period
  Short Name = Actual result
  Definition = The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value
  Requirements = An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or it represents a group of observations
  Comments = Normally, an observation will have either a value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. This element has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueString, valueRange, valueRatio, valueSampledData, valueAttachment, valueTime, valueDateTime, or valuePeriod. (The name format is \"\'value\' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).\r\r\rIf the data element is usually coded or if the type associated with the Observation.value defines a coded value, use CodeableConcept instead of string datatype even if the value is uncoded text.  A value set is bound to the ValueCodeableConcept element.  For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from [HL7 Version 2 Table 0136](v2/0136/index.html). These \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed.   For further discussion and examples see the  [notes section](observation.html#4.20.4) below.

  Requirements = For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.
  Comments = Null or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"specimen unsatisfactory\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.

  Definition = Some observations have multiple component observations.  These component observations are expressed as separate code value pairs that share the same attributes.  Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations.
  Requirements = Component observations share the same attributes in the Observation resource as the primary observation and are always treated a part of a single observation (they are not separable).   However, the reference range for the primary observation value is not inherited by the component values and is required when appropriate for each component observation.

  Short Name = Actual component result
  Definition = The information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value
  Requirements = An observation exists to have a value, though it may not if it is in error, or it represents a group of observations
  Comments = Normally, an observation will have either a value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value.   For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from <http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136> (These \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed\").  The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (The name format is \"\'value\' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).

  Short Name = Why the component result is missing
  Definition = Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.value[x] is missing.
  Requirements = For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.
  Comments = \"Null\" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"test not done\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.

  Requirements = Knowing what values are considered \"normal\" can help evaluate the significance of a particular result. Need to be able to provide multiple reference ranges for different contexts
  Comments = Most observations only have one generic reference range. Systems MAY choose to restrict to only supplying the relevant reference range based on knowledge about the patient (e.g. specific to the patient\'s age, gender, weight and other factors), but this may not be possible or appropriate. Whenever more than one reference range is supplied, the differences between them SHOULD be provided in the reference range and/or age properties

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Name = stats
  Use = Resource
  Documentation = The Statistics operation performs a set of statistical calculations on a set of clinical measurements such as a blood pressure as stored on the server.  This operation is focused on [Observation](observation.html) resources with valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes.\n\nThe set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters: \n\n- the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)\n- which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and \'system\', or \'coding\')\n- the time period over which to generate statistics (\'duration\' or \'period\')\n- the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`). \n\nPossible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):\n\n[[[valueset:observation-statistics]]]\n\n\r\rIf successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.\r\r\n\nThe client can request that all the observations on which the statistics are based be returned as well, using the include parameter. If an include parameter is specified, a limit may also be specified; the sources observations are subsetted at the server\'s discretion if count > limit. This functionality is included with the intent of supporting graphical presentation

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Name = stats.subject
  Use = in
  Documentation = The subject of the relevant Observations, which has the value of the Observation.subject.reference. E.g. \'Patient/123\'. Reference can be to an absolute URL, but servers only perform stats on their own observations

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Name = stats.code
  Use = in
  Documentation = The test code(s) upon which the statistics are being performed. Provide along with a system, or as a coding. For example, the code  = \"45667-2\"  will evaluate all relevant Observations with this code in Observation.code. For LOINC codes that are panels, (e.g. 55284-4) this means to include all the individual codes that are part of a panel

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Name = stats.return
  Use = out
  Documentation = A set of observations, one observation for each code, each containing one component for each statistic. The Observation.component.code contains the statistic, and is relative to the Observation.code and cannot be interpreted independently.  The Observation will also contain a subject, effectivePeriod, and code reflecting the input parameters.  The status is fixed to `final`.
