FHIR resources can be represented as an <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF graph</a> serialised in the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle format</a>. The RDF format is defined to assist the process 
of bridging between operational data exchange and formal knowledge processing systems. While the RDF 
form offers a fully functional representation of FHIR resources, it has different operational 
characteristics to the <a href="json.html">JSON</a> and <a href="xml.html">XML</a> representations, and 
would be implemented for different reasons. Systems focused on operational exchange of data would 
not generally use choose to use RDF.

<h3>Turtle Format for Resources</h3>
<p>
A FHIR resource is represented by a series of RDF triples. The Turtle 
representation for a resource is described using this format:
</p>

<pre class="spec">
Turtle Template

[ a fhir:Observation; fhir:nodeRole fhir:treeRoot;
  # from Resource: id; meta; implicitRules; and language
  # from DomainResource: text; contained; extension; and modifierExtension
  fhir:Obervation.identifier [ <a href="">Identifier</a> ]; # 0..* Unique Id for this particular observation
  fhir:Obervation.status [ fhir:value "&lt;code&gt;" ]; # R!  registered | preliminary | final | amended +
  fhir:Obervation.code [ <a href="">CodeableConcept</a> ]; # 1..1 R!  Type of observation (code / type)
  fhir:Obervation.subject [ fhir:reference [ <a href="">Patient</a>|<a href="">Group</a>|<a href="">Device</a>|<a href="">Location</a> ] ]; # 0..1 Who and/or what this is about
  fhir:Obervation.encounter [ fhir:reference [ <a href="">Encounter</a> ] ]; # 0..1 Healthcare event during which this observation is made
  # effective[x]: 0..1 Clinically relevant time/time-period for observation. One of these 2:
    fhir:Obervation.effectiveDateTime [ fhir:value "&lt;dateTime&gt;" ];
    fhir:Obervation.effectivePeriod [ <a href="">Period</a> ];
]

</pre>
<p>
<i>Note: this is a placeholder for when the proper format is defined</i>.
</p>
<p>
Using this format:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>To build a valid Turtle instance of a resource, replace the contents of the property values with valid content
   as described by the type rules and content description found in the property value for each element</li>
<!--
 <li>In this example:
   <ol>
     <li><code>property1</code> has a primitive data type; the value of the property will be as described for the stated type</li>
     <li><code>property2</code> has a complex data type; the value of the property is an object that has the content as described for the stated type</li>
     <li><code>property3</code> is an object property that contains additional properties (e.g. propertyA; the allowable properties are listed (but also include extensions as appropriate)</li>
     <li><code>property4</code> is an array property that contains items which are objects themselves. The items may have any of the types already encountered in points 1-3</li>
     <li><code>propertyA</code> has a binding to a value set - the Short description is a link to the value set. In addition, the binding strength is shown </li>
     <li><code>propertyB</code> is a reference to a particular kind of resource </li>
   </ol>
 </li> -->
 <li>Relationship names are case-sensitive (though duplicates that differ only in case are never defined)</li>
 <li>Relationships can appear in any order</li>
 <li>Content within a resource is always represented with anonymous nodes - only resources can be identified</li>
 <li>Nodes are never empty. If an element is present in the resource, it SHALL have properties as defined for its type, or 1 or more <a href="extensibility.html">extensions</a></li>
 <li>The <span style="color: brown"><b>R!</b></span> denotes that a relationship is mandatory - it must be present (or in an array, at least one item must be present)</li>
 <li>Note that this specification produces turtle that is nicely formatted and well laid out, but this is not required nor expected</li>
 <li>The MIME-type for this format is <code>text/turtle</code>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="resource"> </a>

<h4>Representing resources</h4>
<p>
Each resource is represented as a set of RDF triples represented using the Turtle syntax.
When a resource has a persistent identity (e.g. it can be found at a particular URL - usually a FHIR RESTful server), 
then that URL is it's identity. Resources with no persistent identity (e.g. bundles from search results) have the the identity is "_".
</p>
<p>
Some resources can contain other resources. Given that the relationships can appear in any order, it
cannot be assumed that the first encountered element represents the resource of interest that is being
represented by the set of turtle statements. The focal resource - where to start when parsing - is the 
resource with the relationship <code>fhir:nodeRole</code> to <code>fhir:treeRoot</code>. if there is 
more than node in a set of turtle statements, it cannot be determined how to parse them as a single
resource.
</p>

<h4>Representing Repeating Elements</h4>

<p>
Elements that can repeat are represented by a relationship 
</p>
<pre class="rdf">
  fhir:index [n]
</pre>
<p>
where [n] is a zero-based integer offset (ie.g the first element has an index of 0).
Lists are never sparse; it is an error if there are missing items in the repeat sequence.
</p>

<a name="primitive"> </a>

<h4>Representing Primitive Elements</h4>
<p>
Primitive elements - elements with a primitive type - are represented as regular nodes so that the 
elements extensions can be represented. The actual value of the primitive type is represented
using the fhir:value predicate:
</p>
<pre class="rdf">
  fhir:value "[value]"^^xs:type
</pre>
<p>
The value is always a literal string that contains the value, followed by a schema type as specified for the <a href="datatypes.html#primitive">primitive type</a>.
The schema type is required, but may be omitted when the defalut value of xs:string is correct. 
Note that the correct schema type for a date/dateTime must be determined by inspecting the value of the date for precision.
</p>
<p>
The fhir:value property can never be empty. Either the relationship is absent, or it is present with at least one character of content. XHTML is represented as an escaped xs:string.
</p>

<a name="reference"> </a>
<h4>Representing References</h4>
<p>
A <a href="references.html#Reference">Reference</a> element is representing using the same
rules as above:
</p>
<pre class="rdf">
 fhir:Observation.subjectReference [
     fhir:Reference.reference [ fhir:value "Patient/example" ];
     fhir:Reference.display [ fhir:value "Example Patient" ];
  ];
</pre>
<p>
This allows faithful round tripping of the resource between the Turtle
format and the JSON and XML formats. But it's very useful for an RDF 
processor to be able to link to the target of the reference directly. 
This can be done using the fhir:link property:
</p>
<pre class="rdf">
 fhir:Observation.subjectReference [
     fhir:link &lt;http://hl7.org/fhir/Patient/example>;
     fhir:Reference.reference [ fhir:value "Patient/example" ]
  ];
</pre>
<p>
The fhir:link relationship can be added automatically 
as part of generating the resource representation, or it
can be injected by a post-processor that knows how to 
convert the raw references into RDF-suitable references. 
</p>

<a name="concept"> </a>
<h4>Representing Concepts</h4>
<p>
The same logic applies to the <a href="datatypes.html#Coding">Coding</a> and 
<a href="datatypes.html#CodeableConcept">CodeableConcept</a> data types.
These are represented directly in turtle by serialising their properties
as specified above:
</p>
<pre class="rdf">
  fhir:Observation.code [
     fhir:CodeableConcept.coding [
       fhir:index 0;
       fhir:Coding.system [ fhir:value "http://loinc.org" ];
       fhir:Coding.code [ fhir:value "29463-7" ];
       fhir:Coding.display [ fhir:value "Body Weight" ]     
    ];
    fhir:CodeableConcept.coding [
       fhir:index 1;
       fhir:Coding.system [ fhir:value "http://snomed.info/sct" ];
       fhir:Coding.code [ fhir:value "27113001" ];
       fhir:Coding.display [ fhir:value "Body weight" ]    
    ]
  ];
</pre>
<p>
For reasoners using the RDF, it's very useful to make the implicit
concept references in these Coding and CodeableConcept explicit
using rdfs:type assertions:
</p>
<pre class="rdf">
  fhir:Observation.code [
     a loinc:29463-7;
     a sct:27113001;
     fhir:CodeableConcept.coding [
       fhir:index 0;
       a loinc:29463-7;
       fhir:Coding.system [ fhir:value "http://loinc.org" ];
       fhir:Coding.code [ fhir:value "29463-7" ];
       fhir:Coding.display [ fhir:value "Body Weight" ]     
     ];
     fhir:CodeableConcept.coding [
       fhir:index 2;
       a sct:27113001;
       fhir:Coding.system [ fhir:value "http://snomed.info/sct" ];
       fhir:Coding.code [ fhir:value "27113001" ];
       fhir:Coding.display [ fhir:value "Body weight" ]     
    ]
  ];
</pre>
<p>
These type assertions can be make by any agent that 
knows how to convert from the code system to the correct
ontological representation of that. Note that a few 
code systems have standard ontological representations,
but many don't. Again, these assertions can be made by 
the serialiser, or injected by a post-processor.

<h4>Schema</h4>

<p>
FHIR uses ShEx for representing the turtle schema.
Todo: actually generate the ShEx schema.

<h3>RDF Representation of FHIR</h3>
<p>
In addition to the basic representation of FHIR resources in 
turtle format, a Turtle representation of the FHIR infrastructure
and definitions is also published, for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Providing the class definitions to support RDF based representation of resource instances</li>
 <li>Supporting knowledge based analysis of the FHIR specification itself</li>
 <li>Providing knowledge of use at run-time for converting between FHIR and other content models</li>
 <li>Supporting reasoning across the information/terminology model boundary</li>
</ul>
<p>
The RDF definitions are published as a series of turtle files: <a href="rim.ttl">RIM</a> and <a href="fhir.ttl">FHIR</a>. Note: these are out of sync with the serialization above; this will be fixed in the lead up to the Montreal connectathon.
