Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn\'t imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.

  Short Label = Amount of medication per dose
  Definition = The amount of therapeutic or other substance given at one administration event.
  Comments = Note that this specifies the quantity of the specified medication, not the quantity for each active ingredient(s). Each ingredient amount can be communicated in the Medication resource. For example, if one wants to communicate that a tablet was 375 mg, where the dose was one tablet, you can use the Medication resource to document that the tablet was comprised of 375 mg of drug XYZ. Alternatively if the dose was 375 mg, then you may only need to use the Medication resource to indicate this was a tablet. If the example were an IV such as dopamine and you wanted to communicate that 400mg of dopamine was mixed in 500 ml of some IV solution, then this would all be communicated in the Medication resource. If the administration is not intended to be instantaneous (rate is present or timing has a duration), this can be specified to convey the total amount to be administered over the period of time as indicated by the schedule e.g. 500 ml in dose, with timing used to convey that this should be done over 4 hours.

  Definition = The maximum total quantity of a therapeutic substance that may be administered to a subject over the period of time.  For example, 1000mg in 24 hours.
  Comments = This is intended for use as an adjunct to the dosage when there is an upper cap.  For example \"2 tablets every 4 hours to a maximum of 8/day\"

 -- Row 23 -----------------------------------

  Card. = 0..1
  Type = SimpleQuantity
  Short Label = Upper limit on medication per administration
  Definition = The maximum total quantity of a therapeutic substance that may be administered to a subject per administration.
  Comments = This is intended for use as an adjunct to the dosage when there is an upper cap.  For example, a body surface area related dose with a maximum amount, such as 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum 2 mg) IV over 5 – 10 minutes would have doseQuantity of 1.5 mg/m2 and maxDosePerAdministration of 2 mg.

  Short Label = Amount of medication per unit of time
  Definition = Identifies the speed with which the medication was or will be introduced into the patient. Typically the rate for an infusion e.g. 100 ml per 1 hour or 100 ml/hr.  May also be expressed as a rate per unit of time e.g. 500 ml per 2 hours.   Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.  Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g.  500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours).  However, when rate doesn\'t imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.
  Comments = It is possible to supply both a rate and a doseQuantity to provide full details about how the medication is to be administered and supplied. If the rate is intended to change over time, depending on local rules/regulations, each change should be captured as a new version of the MedicationOrder with an updated rate, or captured with a new MedicationOrder with the new rate.

 -- Row 26 -----------------------------------

  Short Label = Medication supply authorization
  Definition = Indicates the specific details for the dispense or medication supply part of a medication order (also known as a Medication Prescription).  Note that this information is NOT always sent with the order.  There may be in some settings (e.g. hospitals) institutional or system support for completing the dispense details in the pharmacy department.

  Definition = This indicates the validity period of a prescription (stale dating the Prescription)
  Requirements = Indicates when the Prescription becomes valid, and when it ceases to be a dispensable Prescription.
  Comments = It reflects the prescriber perspective for the validity of the prescription. Dispenses must not be made against the prescription outside of this period. The lower-bound of the Dispensing Window signifies the earliest date that the prescription can be filled for the first time. If an upper-bound is not specified then the Prescription is open-ended or will default to a stale-date based on regulations.

 -- Row 28 -----------------------------------
  Element = MedicationOrder.dispenseRequest.numberOfRepeatsAllowed

  Short Label = Number of refills authorized
  Definition = An integer indicating the number of times, in addition to the original dispense, (aka refills or repeats) that the patient can receive the prescribed medication. Usage Notes: This integer does NOT include the original order dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus \"3 repeats\", then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient can receive a total of 120 tablets.

  Short Label = Number of days supply per dispense
  Definition = Identifies the period time over which the supplied product is expected to be used, or the length of time the dispense is expected to last.
  Comments = In some situations, this attribute may be used instead of quantity to identify the amount supplied by how long it is expected to last, rather than the physical quantity issued, e.g. 90 days supply of medication (based on an ordered dosage) When possible, it is always better to specify quantity, as this tends to be more precise. expectedSupplyDuration will always be an estimate that can be influenced by external factors.
