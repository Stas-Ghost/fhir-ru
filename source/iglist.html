<h2>Implementation Guides defined as part of FHIR</h2>
 
<p>
An Implementation Guide is a collection of <a href="profile.html">Profiles</a>, <a href="conformance.html">Conformance</a>
requirements, <a href="valueset.html">ValueSets</a> and other resources, together with textual guidance, that provides instruction
on how to make use of FHIR in a particular problem space.  Implementation guides may be developed and published as part of
a FHIR release or as separate specifications.  Additional support and tooling for implementation guides is being developed, so
the content provided here should be considered "preliminary" from a publication perspective.
