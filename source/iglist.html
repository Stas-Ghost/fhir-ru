<p>
An Implementation Guide is a collection of <a href="profiling.html">Profiles</a>, that make <a href="conformance-rules.html">Conformance</a>
rules (technially, <a href="capabilitystatement.html">CapabilityStatement</a>, <a href="structuredefinition.html">StructureDefinition</a>, <a href="valueset.html">ValueSet</a>, etc.) 
that, together with textual guidance, provides instruction on how to make use of FHIR in a particular problem space.  Implementation 
guides may be developed and published as part of a FHIR release or as separate specifications.  Additional support and tooling for 
implementation guides is being developed, so the content provided here should be considered "preliminary" from a publication perspective.
</p>
<p>
The implementation guides include artifacts with a set of representations generated from the conformance resources. 
All the representation forms are equally normative. Many examples are also provided, and considerable care is taken
over them. However, unless indicated otherwise, the examples have no formal standing (see <a href="conformance-rules.html#examples">General Notes
about examples</a>).
