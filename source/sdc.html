<h2>Structured Data Capture (SDC) Implementation Guide</h2>
<p>
This implementation guide is prepared as a U.S. Realm Specfication on behalf ot the 
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc">U.S. Office of the National Coordinator (ONC)</a>.
However, much of the content is likely to be useable in other jurisdictions.  Information that is
U.S.-specific has therefore been categorized into a single section.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="sdc-intro.html">Introduction</a> - How this project came to be and what it's trying to achieve</li>
  <li><a href="sdc-usecase.html">Use Cases</a> - Specific scenarios supported by the IG</li>
  <li><a href="http://http://wiki.siframework.org/Structured+Data+Capture+Initiative">Project wiki containing development materials and discussions (for additional background)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Specification</h3>
<p>
The <i>SDC FHIR Implementation Guide</i> is built on top of the <a href="index.html">HL7 FHIR</a> standard.  It makes use of the following resources:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="dataelement.html">DataElement</a> is used to define data elements that can be referenced in questionnaires and can be used to auto-populate form data</li>
  <li><a href="questionnaire.html">Questionnaire</a> is used to define form definitions that may be downloaded for manual and/or automatic population</li>
  <li><a href="questionnaireanswers.html">QuestionnaireAnswers</a> is used to share instance data captured using questionnaire forms</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additional resources such as <a href="patient.html">Patient</a>, <a href="practitioner.html">Practitioner</a> and others are likely to be used in SDC solutions, though
no SDC-specific profiles have been created for them.  As well, basic aspects of the FHIR protocol, including <a href="http.html">RESTful operations</a>, 
<a href="datatypes.html">data types</a>, <a href="search.html">search</a>, etc. also apply.
<!-- Todo: decide how explicit the list of relevant sections needs to be -->
</p>
<p>
The SDC specification is broken into the following components:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="sdc-interactions.html">Interactions</a> - A listing of the resource operations used to support the SDC implementation guide as well as the definition of a custom service for form auto-population</li>
  <li><b>SDC profiles</b> - Profiles on the three FHIR resources used to support the IG requirements:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="dataelement-sdc.html">SDC Data Element (DE) Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for capturing data elements</li>
      <li><a href="questionnaire-sdc.html">SDC Questionnaire Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for capturing form designs</li>
      <li><a href="questionnaireanswers-sdc.html">SDC Questionnaire Answers Profile</a> - Constraints and extensions for capturing form data instances</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="sdc-dataelements.html">Data Elements</a> - A set of data element definitions to be supported and mapped to by compliant systems for use in form auto-population</li>
</ul>
