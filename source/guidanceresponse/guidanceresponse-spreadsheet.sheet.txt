=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Label = The formal response to a guidance request
  Definition = A guidance response is the formal response to a previous guidance request. It is a derivative of the knowledge response that provides additional information relevant specifically to clinical decision support such as a description of any proposed actions to be taken
  w5 = clinical.general

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.requestId
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = string
  Short Label = The id of the request associated with this response, if any
  Definition = The id of the request associated with this response. If an id was provided as part of the request, it will be provided here to enable the requester to more easily identify the response in a multi-request scenario

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.module
  Card. = 1..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Summary = Y
  Type = Reference(DecisionSupportServiceModule|DecisionSupportRule)
  Short Label = A reference to a knowledge module
  Definition = A reference to a knowledge module involved in an interaction

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.status
  Card. = 1..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Summary = Y
  Type = code
  Binding = GuidanceResponseStatus
  Short Label = success | data-requested | data-required | in-progress | failure
  Definition = The status of the response. If the evaluation is completed successfully, the status will indicate success. However, in order to complete the evaluation, the engine may require more information. In this case, the status will be data-required, and the response will contain a description of the additional required information. If the evaluation completed successfully, but the engine determines that a potentially more accurate response could be provided if more data was available, the status will be data-requested, and the response will contain a description of the additional requested information

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.evaluationMessage
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Reference(OperationOutcome)
  Short Label = Messages resulting from the evaluation of the artifact or artifacts
  Definition = Messages resulting from the evaluation of the artifact or artifacts. As part of evaluating the request, the engine may produce informational or warning messages. These messages will be provided by this element

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.outputParameters
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Parameters)
  Short Label = The output parameters of the evaluation, if any
  Definition = The output parameters of the evaluation, if any. Many modules will result in the return of specific resources such as procedure or communication requests that are returned as part of the operation result. However, modules may define specific outputs that would be returned as the result of the evaluation, and these would be returned in this element

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.action
  Card. = 0..*
  Definition = The actions, if any, produced by the evaluation of the artifact

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------

  Type = Attachment
  Definition = Supporting evidence for the action

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.action.documentation
  Card. = 0..*
  Type = Attachment
  Definition = Supporting documentation for the action

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------

  Element = GuidanceResponse.action.type
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = code
  Binding = GuidanceResponseActionType
  Short Label = create | update | remove | fire-event
  Definition = The type of action to perform (create, update, remove)

 -- Row 18 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceResponse.action.resource
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Any)
