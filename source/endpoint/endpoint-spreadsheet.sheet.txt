  Definition = The organization that manages this endpoint (even if technically another organisation is hosting this in the cloud, it is the organisation associated with the data)
  Comments = This property is not typically used when searching for Endpoint resources for usage. The typical usage is via the reference from an aplicable Organization/Location/Practitioner resource, which is where the context is provided. Multiple Locations may reference a single endpoint, and don\'t have to be within the same organization resource, but most likely within the same organizational heirarchy
  RIM Mapping = n/a

  Summary = y
  Type = uri
  Short Label = Where the channel points to
  Definition = The uri that describes the actual end-point to send messages to
  Comments = For rest-hook, and websocket, the end-point must be an http: or https: URL; for email, a mailto: url, for sms, a tel: url, and for message the endpoint can be in any form of url the server understands (usually, http: or mllp:). The URI is allowed to be relative; in which case, it is relative to the server end-point (since their may be more than one, clients should avoid using relative URIs)

  RIM Mapping = n/a
  To Do = Should this have multiple cardinality?

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Element = Endpoint.payloadType
  Card. = 1..*
  Summary = Y
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = PayloadType
  Short Label = The type of content that may be used at this endpoint (e.g. XDS Discharge summaries)

  Short Label = Usage depends on the channel type
  Definition = Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification
