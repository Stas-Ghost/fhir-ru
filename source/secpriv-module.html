<h2>Security and Privacy Module</h2>

<a id="intro"> </a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The Security and Privacy Module describes how to protect a FHIR server (through
access control and authorization), how to document what permissions a user has
granted (consent), and how to keep records about what events have been
performed (audit logging and provenance). FHIR does not mandate a single
technical approach to security and privacy; rather, the specification provides
a set of building blocks that can be applied to create secure, private systems.

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
Security in FHIR includes the set of considerations required to ensure that
data can be discovered, accessed, or altered only in accordance with
expectations and policies. FHIR includes implementation guidance to ensure
that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All communications can be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access
</li>
<li>
No information leaks when errors occur
</li>
<li>
No active script content can be injected into narrative resources
</li>
<li>
Full audit trails can be constructed and used to detect anomalous access patterns
</li>
<li>
  For general considerations and principles, see <a href="security.html">Security</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>

Privacy in FHIR includes the set of considerations required to ensure that
individual data are treated according to an individual's preferences. FHIR
includes implementation guidance to ensure that:

</p>

<ul>
<li>
  Individual preferences can be communicated through standards-based protocols
  (e.g., OAuth, User-Managed Access) or using an explicit FHIR representation
  (<a href="consent">Consent</a>) </li>
<li>
  Resources can be tagged to indicate the sensitivity or confidentiality of the data they represent (<a href="security-labels.html">Security Labels</a>)
</li>
<li>
  Data access records and audit logs can be shared with individuals, e.g. for accounting of disclosures (<a href="auditevent.html">Audit Event</a>)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Use Cases</h3>

<h4>
Authorization and Access Control
</h4>

<p>

<em>Use case:</em> A FHIR server should ensure that API access is allowed for
authorized requests, and denied for unauthorized requests.

</p>

<p>

<em>Approach:</em> Authorization details can vary according to local policy,
and according to the access scenario (e.g. sharing data among
institution-internal subsystems vs. sharing data with trusted partners vs.
sharing data with third-party user-facing apps). In general, FHIR enables a
separation of concerns between the FHIR REST API and standards-based
authorization protocols like OAuth. For the use case of user-facing third-party
app authorization, we recommend the OAuth-based SMART protocol (ref) as an
externally-reviewed authorization mechanism with a real-world deployment base â€”
but we note that community efforts are underway to explore a variety of
approaches to authorization. For details, see <a href="security.html#binding">Security: Binding</a>.

</p>

<h4>
Audit Logging
</h4>

<p>

<em>Use case:</em> "A FHIR server should keep a complete, tamper-proof log of
all API access and other security- and privacy-relevant events".

</p>

<p>

<em>Approach:</em> Approach: FHIR provides an AuditEvent resource suitable for
use by FHIR clients and servers to record when a security or privacy relevant
event has occurred. This form of audit logging records as much detail as
reasonable at the time the event happened. For details, see
<a href="security.html#audit">Security: Audit</a> + add reference to ATNA for
conseptual background (GG).

<h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>

<p>
In the STU3 release, FHIR includes building blocks and principles for creating
secure, privacy-oriented health IT systems; FHIR does not mandate a single
technical approach to security and privacy.
</p>

<p>
 In future releases, we are anticipate including:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
More specific implementation guidance for particular Authorization scenarios
(for example, we may incorporate the SMART on FHIR authorization specification
for user-authorized apps).
</li>
<li>
More details about how to use digital Signatures for data integrity and
non-repudiation, including an approach that supports some level of manipulation
of resources (e.g. separating the entries in a bundle, or conversion between
XML and JSON during processing)
</li>
<li>
More detailed Consent management, including support for specific consent use cases.
</li>
</ul>
