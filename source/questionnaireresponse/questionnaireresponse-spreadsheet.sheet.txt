  Short Name = Single-valued answer to the question
  Definition = The answer (or one of the answers) provided by the respondent to the question
  Requirements = Ability to retain a single-valued answer to a question
  Comments = More complex structures (Attachment, Resource and Quantity) will typically be limited to electronic forms that can expose an appropriate user interface to capture the components and enforce the constraints of a complex data type.  Additional complex types can be introduced through extensions.
