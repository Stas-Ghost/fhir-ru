<h2>Scope and Usage</h2>
<p>
PractitionerRole covers the recording of the location and types of services that Practitioners are able to provide
for an organization.
</p>
<p>
The role, specialty, Location telecom and HealthcareService properties can be repeated if required in other instances
of the PractitionerRole. Some systems record a collection of service values for a single location, others record the 
single service and the list of locations it is available. Both are acceptable options for prepresenting this data.

	The Qualifications are not a part of the PractitionerRole, as they may be appropriate for the role,
    however they are a property of the Practitioner, not the role they may perform for an Organization.

<h2>Background and Context</h2>
<p>
Practitioner performs different roles within the same or even different organizations. Depending on jurisdiction and custom, 
it may be necessary to maintain a specific Practitioner Resource for each such role or have a single Practitioner with multiple roles.
The role can be limited to a specific period, after which authorization for this role ends. Note that the represented organization
need not necessarily be the (direct) employer of a Practitioner.
