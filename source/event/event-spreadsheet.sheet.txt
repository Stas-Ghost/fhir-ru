  Definition = Codes identifying the stage lifecycle stage of a event

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventCode

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Binding Name = EventReason
  Binding = unbound
  Definition = Codes identifying why this event was necessary.  These may be clinical reasons (e.g. diagnoses, symptoms) and/or administrative reasons.  While the detailed constraints of relevant reasons will vary by resource, some degree of consistency across resources around recommended codes would be desirable.

=== Sheet event-status =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Id = 1
  Code = preparation

  Definition = The core event has not started yet, but some staging activities have begun (e.g. surgical suite preparation).  Preparation stages may be tracked for billing purposes.

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Id = 6
  Code = entered-in-error
  Display = Entered in Error
  Definition = This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it.  (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be \"cancelled\" rather than \"entered-in-error\".)
