=== Sheet Data Elements =====================================

 -- Row 1 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest
  Type = DomainResource
  Short Label = A request for decision support guidance
  Definition = A guidance request is a request to evaluate a particular knowledge module focused on decision support, providing information relevant to decision support such as workflow and user context.
  w5 = clinical.general

 -- Row 2 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.module
  Card. = 1..1
  Is Modifier = Y
  Summary = Y
  Type = Reference(DecisionSupportRule|DecisionSupportServiceModule)
  Short Label = A reference to a knowledge module
  Definition = A reference to a knowledge module involved in an interaction
  w5 = what

 -- Row 3 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.dateTime
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = The date and time of the request
  Definition = The date and time of the request, with respect to the initiator
  w5 = when.init

 -- Row 4 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.evaluateAtDateTime
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = dateTime
  Short Label = Indicates that the evaluation should be performed as though it was the given date and time
  Definition = Indicates that the evaluation should be performed as though it was the given date and time. The most direct implication of this is that references to \"Now\" within the evaluation logic of the module should result in this value. In addition, wherever possible, the data accessed by the module should appear as though it was accessed at this time. The evaluateAtDateTime value may be any time in the past or future, enabling both retrospective and prospective scenarios. If no value is provided, the requestDateTime is assumed
  w5 = when.init

 -- Row 5 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.inputParameters
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Parameters)
  Short Label = The input parameters for a request, if any
  Definition = The input parameters for a request, if any. These parameters are used to provide patient-independent information to the evaluation. Patient-specific information is either accessed directly as part of the evaluation (because the evaluation engine and the patient-data are co-located) or provided as part of the operation input in the form of resources

 -- Row 6 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.initiatingOrganization
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Organization)
  Definition = The organization initiating the request
  w5 = who

 -- Row 7 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.initiatingPerson
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Person|Patient|Practitioner|RelatedPerson)
  Definition = The person initiating the request
  w5 = who

 -- Row 8 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.userType
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = The type of user initiating the request
  Definition = The type of user initiating the request, e.g. patient, healthcare provider, or specific type of healthcare provider (physician, nurse, etc.)

 -- Row 9 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.userLanguage
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = Language
  Definition = Preferred language of the person using the system

 -- Row 10 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.userTaskContext
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Short Label = The task the system user is performing
  Definition = The task the system user is performing, e.g. laboratory results review, medication list review, etc. This information can be used to tailor decision support outputs, such as recommended information resources
  w5 = why

 -- Row 11 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.receivingOrganization
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Organization)
  Definition = The organization that will receive the response

 -- Row 12 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.receivingPerson
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = Reference(Person|Patient|Practitioner|RelatedPerson)
  Definition = The person in the receiving organization that will receive the response

 -- Row 13 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.recipientType
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Definition = The type of individual that will consume the response content. This may be different from the requesting user type (e.g. if a clinician is getting disease management guidance for provision to a patient). E.g. patient, healthcare provider or specific type of healthcare provider (physician, nurse, etc.)

 -- Row 14 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.recipientLanguage
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = Language
  Definition = Preferred language of the person that will consume the content

 -- Row 15 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.encounterClass
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = EncounterClass
  Definition = The class of encounter (inpatient, outpatient, etc)
  w5 = why

 -- Row 16 -----------------------------------
  Element = GuidanceRequest.encounterType
  Card. = 0..1
  Type = CodeableConcept
  Binding = EncounterType
  Definition = The type of the encounter
  w5 = why
