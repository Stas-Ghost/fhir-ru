<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>
This is the developmental version of FHIR. The only changes tracked here are 
changes from after the publication of the DSTU. For changes from before this, 
see the <a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/history.html">DSTU Version History</a>.
Note that a full archive history of everything is available 
<a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=FHIR">through the HL7 gForge SVN archives</a>.

<h3>How FHIR Versioning works</h3>
<p><i>This section is draft</i></p>
<p>
The FHIR version policy is based on <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a>, but with 
some differences due to fact that FHIR is a specification, not a software API.
</p>
<p>
There is a single development version of FHIR. This undergoes cycles of development as 
managed by HL7. Each major cycle of development is concluded by a formal ballot, and then 
a new specification is published. in version control terms, each specification is a 
branch off the development trunk, which may then itself undergo further change as 
HL7 maintains the published specification. 
</p>
<p>
The following kinds of changes may be made to the specification:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Non-substantiative changes do not cause changes in any conformant application. For example, section renumbering, 
   broken links, style corrections, typos, and clarifications that do not change the meaning. Some corrections may 
   be judged not to create any expectation of change to a conformant application</li>
 <li>New functionality - changes to the specification that create new capabilities, but would not render existing applications non-conformant if they do note change</li>
 <li>Breaking changes would mean that previously conformant applications are not longer conformant</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the following are, by definition, considered non-breading changes: creation of new resources or new elements in an existing resource, or new datatypes, or new API operations, even though some implementations may not accept these without error.
Also, examples are never substantiative - every effort is made to ensure that they are correct, but changes to the examples are not considered substantiative.
</p>

<p>
Each FHIR version is identified by a string composed from 4 parts: publication.major.minor.revision. 
</p>
<table class="lines">
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">publication</td>
   <td>
     <ul>
       <li>Incremented when HL7 publishes FHIR as an updated specification, e.g. a DSTU or normative version of FHIR</li>
       <li>HL7 plans to do this every 1 to 2 years</li>
       <li>The first DSTU was version 0</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">major</td>
   <td>
     <ul>
       <li>Increments every time a breaking change is made</li>
       <li>When a new publication is made, this is reset to 0 in the publication, and 1 in the development branch</li>
       <li>Since HL7 does not make breaking changes as technical corrections to a published specification, formally published version of FHIR always have a version number X.0.n.r</li>
       <li>Because the development version is the subject of ongoing analysis, debate, ballot and repeated alterations, breaking changes are to be expected</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">minor</td>
   <td>
     <ul>
       <li>Increments every time a substantive change is made</li>
       <li>Resets to 0 any time the major version changes</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign="top">revision</td>
   <td>
     <ul>
       <li>Incremented any time a change is made to the specification</li>
       <li>At present, this is the SVN version number (this allows anyone to reconstruct the source from which the version was built from)</li>
     </ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Additional notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Changes to a formally published specification (except for minor publishing corrections, such as correcting broken links) are only made via announced technical corrections</li>
 <li>The reference implementations have 2 versions - the version of the specification that they implement, and their own version. Consult the reference implementation documentation for policy regarding this version number</li>
 <li>The specification published by the continuous integration service (<a href="http://hl7-fhir.github.io/">http://hl7-fhir.github.io/</a>) build may not conform to this version policy, 
   but the version published on the HL7 web site will (<a href="http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/">http://hl7.org/implement/standards/FHIR-Develop/</a>)</li>
 <li>The first DSTU was published prior to these rules being agreed as v0.80-2286. This will be updated to 0.0.81.[svn] as a technical correction to align with this policy</li>
</ul>
