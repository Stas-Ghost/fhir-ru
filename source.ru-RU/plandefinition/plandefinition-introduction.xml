<h2>Область применения и использование</h2>
<p>
<i>Данный ресурс - это техническое предложение для использования в рамках подхода к Клиническому качеству в FHIR, задокументированное в составе модуля <a href="clinicalreasoning-module.html">Клиническое обоснование</a>.<!-- This resource is a draft proposal for use as part of an approach to Clinical Quality within FHIR, and is documented as part of the <a href="clinicalreasoning-module.html">Clinical Reasoning</a> module. --></i>
</p>

<p>A plan definition is a pre-defined group of actions to be taken in particular circumstances, often including conditions, options, and other decision points. The resource is flexible enough to be used to represent a variety of clinical decision support and quality improvement assets, including order sets, protocols, and decision support rules.</p>

<!--
<p>An order set is a pre-defined and approved group of actions related to a particular clinical condition (e.g. hypertension treatment and monitoring) or stage of care (e.g. hospital admission to Coronary Care Unit). An order set is used as a checklist for the clinician when managing a patient with a specific condition. It is a structured collection of orders relevant to that condition and presented to the clinician in a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system.</p>

This draft resource has been published for Workflow group discussion purposes. It is used to define the set of activities that can be peformed that have relationships in terms of order, pre-conditions etc. see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_guideline">Visit W3Schools</a>  For example <a href="http://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/CD/htn/VADoDCPGfortheManagementofHTN.pdf">Visit W3Schools</a>  (todo)

<!-- Describes some of the situations/use cases intended to be managed with the resource. May include a child div for "Storyboards" and "Related Specifications". The purpose of this section is to help implementers understand why the resource is needed and how it might be used. -->

<!--
<p>The Metadata component represents topical metadata such as the title, description, publication information and lifecycle, as well as usage documentation and supporting evidence. The Library component allows order sets to reference logic that can be used to control conditional behavior as the order set is realized. And finally, the Action component provides the ability to define hierarchical groups of actions, where each specific action defines an orderable line item, together with behaviors that determine how the orderable items are related to each other.</p>
-->

<p>PlanDefinitions can contain hierarchical groups of actions, where each specific action defines an activity to be performed (in terms of an ActivityDefinition resource), and each group defines additional behavior, relationships, and applicable conditions between the actions in the overall definition.</p>

<p>In addition to describing what should take place, each action in a plan definition can specify <i>when</i> and <i>whether</i> the action should take place. For when the action should be taken, the triggerDefinition element specifies the action should be taken in response to some trigger occurring (such as a particular point in a workflow being reached, or as the result of a prescription being ordered). For whether the action should be taken, the condition element can be used to provide an expression that evaluates to true or false to indicate the applicability of the action to the specific context.</p>

<p>The process of applying a PlanDefinition to a particular context typically produces request resources representing the actions that should be performed, potentially grouped within a CarePlan to capture relationships between the resulting request resources.</p>

<p>Each ActivityDefinition is used to construct a specific resource, based on the definition of the activity and combined with contextual information for the particular patient that the plan definition is being applied to.</p>

<p>As with the ActivityDefinition, a PlanDefinition may provide information about how to transform the activity to a specific intent resource, either by specifying a <a href="structuremap.html">StructureMap</a> that can be used to perform the transformation completely, or by specifying values for specific elements of the resulting resource using <code>dynamicValue</code> elements in the action.</p>

<p>Note that these mechanisms are provided on both the ActivityDefinition and the PlanDefinition to allow both reusable transformation descriptions, as well as customization of those descriptions within specific contexts. As such, the transform descriptions specified on the PlanDefinition <i>override</i> transform descriptions defined on the ActivityDefinition.</p>

<p>Dynamic values within the definitions can be provided by specifying the expression directly, or by referencing an expression defined within a library. For more information on how to reference expressions within resources, refer to the Languages topic.</p>

<p>As an example, the Low Suicide Risk example order set from the Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification can be represented using the PlanDefinition and ActivityDefinition structures: <a href="plandefinition-example.html">Low Suicide Risk Example Order Set</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the representation of PlanDefinitions, the <a href="plandefinition-operations.html#apply">$apply</a> operation allows PlanDefinitions to be realized for a specific context such as a patient, practitioner, or institution. For Order Sets specifically, this operation is expected to place the orders defined by the order set, consistent with the service functional requirements defined by the Order Set Service specification.</p>

<h2>Boundaries and Relationships</h2>
<p>The PlanDefinition resource is used to describe series, sequences, or groups of actions to be taken, while the <a href="activitydefinition.html">ActivityDefinition</a> resource is used to define each specific step or activity to be performed.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the PlanDefinition resource is strictly definitional. It does not represent the intention to take any action, nor does it represent that any actions have been taken. Rather, the resource provides a definition that can be applied in the appropriate circumstances. When the plan definition is applied, the result will in general be a set of actions that should be (or potentially even have been) performed.</p>

<p>Note that the PlanDefinition still has action-level information, as well as a reference to an <a href="activitydefinition.html">ActivityDefinition</a>. The action-level information defined in the PlanDefinition itself is used to describe how the actions are related to eachother within the plan, where the ActivityDefinition contains only information about the activity itself.</p>
