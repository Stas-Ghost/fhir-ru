  RIM Mapping = Act.availabilityTime.  Definition: A time expression specifying when an Observation, Procedure, or other Act occurs, or, depending on the mood, is supposed to occur, scheduled to occur, etc. The activityTime includes the times of component actions (such as preparation and clean-up). For Procedures and SubstanceAdministrations, the activityTime can provide a needed administrative function by providing a more inclusive time to be anticipated in scheduling. UsageNotes:The activityTime is primarily of administrative rather than clinical use. The clinically relevant time is the effectiveTime. When an observation of a prior symptom is made, the activityTime describes the time the observation is made, as opposed to effectiveTime which is the time the symptom is reported to have occurred. Thus the activityTime may be entirely different from the effectiveTime of the same Act. However, even apart from clinical use cases, designers should first consider effectiveTime as the primary relevant time for an Act. ActivityTime indicates when an Act occurs, not when it is recorded.

  Definition = The matter of concern in the context of this agreement.
  Requirements = In the context of a contract, the topic is the matter under consideration in regards to which specific rights, privileges, obligations, restrictions, and prohibitions are binding on any grantor and grantee parties upon the execution of the contract. \rGiven the wide range of contract topics, implementers need to be cognizant of the business use case for which they are designing a FHIR Contract, and narrowly specify the topic being represented with respect to the Contract.type and any specializing Contract.subtype. \rThe same topic, e.g., an asset such as a good or service, such as a real property, medical supply, insurance, information, a procedure or employment, or a manner of conduct, such adherence to a privacy, trust, or security policy, may be the topic of multiple types of contracts. \rOne way to determine the Contract.topic is to answer the question: “What is the object of negotiation?”\rAnswer: The Contract.topic, which may be described with more detail in the [0..*]Contract.valuedItem @ [0..1] Contract.valuedItem.entity[x] Definition: Specific type of Contract Valued Item that may be priced. CodeableConcept|Reference(Any)\rContract.topic is “the what” that a grantor is exchanging with a grantee in return for some benefit. \rContract.topic is “the what” to which any Contract.action is being applied for any stipulated Contract.action.reason. \rAContract.topic is “the what” governed by the execution of the contract to which any party’s rights, privileges, obligations, restrictions, and prohibitions apply.
  Comments = The Contract.topic may be an application for or offer of a policy or service (e.g., uri to a consent directive form or a health insurance policy), which becomes the Contract once accepted by both the grantor and grantee. \rThe Contract Resource may function simply as the computable representation of the executed contract, which may be the attached to the Contract Resource as the “binding” or as the “friendly” electronic form.  For example, a Contract Resource may be automatically populated with the values expressed in a related QuestionnaireResponse. \rHowever, the Contract Resource may be considered the legally binding contract if it is the only “executed” form of this contract, and includes the signatures as *The Contract Resource may function as the computable representation of an application or offer in a pre-executed Contract if the grantor has not entered any values.  In this case, it is populated with values in a “legal” form of the application or offer or by the values in an associated Questionnaire.  If the grantor has filled in the legal form or the associated Questionnaire Response, then these values are used to populate a pre-executed Contract Resource.\rIf the Contract.topic is considered an application or offer, then the policy is often required to be attached as the “legal” basis for the application to ensure “informed consent” to the contract, and that any discrepancy between the application and the policy are interpreted against the policy.  Implementers should check organizational and jurisdictional policies to determine the relationship among multiple representations of a contract pre- and post-execution.

  RIM Mapping = Maps to multiple ActClass and ActCode Concept Domains and Code Systems such as the following:   In the ActClass Concept Domain: ActClassPolicy. In the ActCode Concept Domain:   ActContractType, which generalizes ActFinancialContractType, ActCoverageType, ActBillingArrangementType.  ActConsentType, which generalizes ActDataConsentType; ActFinancialParticipationConsentType; ActInformationAccessCode; AdvanceBeneficiaryNoticeType.  ActPolicyType, which generalizes: ActPrivacyPolicyType, ActSensitivityPrivacyPolicyType, ActSecurityPolicyType.  In the ActClass Code System:  CNTRCT (contract) Description: An agreement of obligation between two or more parties that is subject to contractual law and enforcement, lwhich generalizes FCNTRCT (financial contract) and COV (coverage).  POLICY (policy) - Description: A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by one party on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed. LEAF CONCEPTS: JURISPOL (jurisdictional policy) Description:A mandate, regulation, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation unilaterally imposed by a jurisdiction on: The activity of another party; the behavior of another party; or the manner in which an act is executed.Examples:A jurisdictional mandate regarding the prescribing and dispensing of a particular medication. A jurisdictional privacy or security regulation dictating the manner in which personal health information is disclosed. A jurisdictional requirement that certain services or health conditions are reported to a monitoring program, e.g., immunizations, methadone treatment, or cancer registries.ORGPOL (organizational policy)Examples:A clinical or research protocols imposed by a payer, a malpractice insurer, or an institution to which a provider must adhere. A mandate imposed by a denominational institution for a provider to provide or withhold certain information from the patient about treatment options.SCOPOL (scope of practice policy)Description:An ethical or clinical obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation imposed or strongly encouraged by organizations that oversee particular clinical domains or provider certification which define the boundaries within which a provider may practice and which may have legal basis or ramifications.Examples:An ethical obligation for a provider to fully inform a patient about all treatment options. An ethical obligation for a provider not to disclose personal health information that meets certain criteria, e.g., where disclosure might result in harm to the patient or another person. The set of health care services which a provider is credentialed or privileged to provide. STDPOL (standard of practice policy) Examples:A payer may require a prescribing provider to adhere to formulary guidelines. An institution may adopt clinical guidelines and protocols and implement these within its electronic health record and decision support systems.  CONS (consent)Description: The Consent class represents informed consents and all similar medico-legal transactions between the patient (or his legal guardian) and the provider. Examples are informed consent for surgical procedures, informed consent for clinical trials, advanced beneficiary notice, against medical advice decline from service, release of information agreement, etc.  The details of consents vary. Often an institution has a number of different consent forms for various purposes, including reminding the physician about the topics to mention. Such forms also include patient education material. In electronic medical record communication, consents thus are information-generating acts on their own and need to be managed similar to medical activities. Thus, Consent is modeled as a special class of Act. The \"signatures\" to the consent document are represented electronically through Participation instances to the consent object. Typically an informed consent has Participation.typeCode of \"performer\", the healthcare provider informing the patient, and \"consenter\", the patient or legal guardian. Some consent may associate a witness or a notary public (e.g., living wills, advanced directives). In consents where a healthcare provider is not required (e.g. living will), the performer may be the patient himself or a notary public.
