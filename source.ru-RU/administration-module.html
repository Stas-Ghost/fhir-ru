            The Administrative module covers the base data that is then linked into
            the other modules for clinical content, finance/billing, workflow, etc.<br />
            This of course is built on the FHIR technology platform modules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before any clinical data can be recorded, the basic information on the patient
            must be recorded, and then often the basis of the interaction (such as an encounter)

        <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            Patient privacy is handled with security labels and tags in the Resource <a href="resource.html#Meta">Meta</a> property.
            This is the standard way that the FHIR specification provides this supporting information
            to a sub-system that implements it (which is not defined by FHIR).
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the more common use cases is for marking a patient as being a <a href="security-labels.html">celebrity</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more general considerations, see <a href="secpriv-module.html">the Security and Privacy module</a>.

        <h3>Common use Cases</h3>
        <p>
            All systems require access to administrative resources, such as for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining master file lists of patients, practitioners, organizations, locations, etc.</li>
            <li>Synchronizing/interrogating content from an external registry. Such as a Services Directory or centralized Person register</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <a name="roadmap"> </a>
        <h3>Developmental Roadmap</h3>
        <p>
            The Patient Administration is currently working through resources that support:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encounters and Scheduling <i>(enhance maturity of encounters and further develop in/outpatient scheduling)</i></li>
            <li>Service Provider Directory <i>(in co-ordination with the Argonaut Provider Directory group)</i></li>
            <li>Financial Management interactions <i>(account/coverage, then billable item, which links administration to billing)</i></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Many of the administrative resources are part of the core resources that most systems
            use first and have formed the basis for most people's first experiences with FHIR.<br />
            However this limitted exposure has still to be proven in all contexts, such as veterinary.
