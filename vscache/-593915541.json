Examples:\r\nPhysically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:\r\nParticularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:\r\nThere needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.","compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode"}]},"expansion":{"identifier":"urn:uuid:257e7e16-9c5e-4338-8dd3-772479ccdc7a","timestamp":"2016-06-17T17:49:53+10:00","parameter":[{"name":"version","valueUri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode?version=2016-03-23"}],"contains":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"ELECTRONIC","display":"electronic data"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"PHYSICAL","display":"physical presence"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"REMOTE","display":"remote presence"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"VERBAL","display":"verbal"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"DICTATE","display":"dictated"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"FACE","display":"face-to-face"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"PHONE","display":"telephone"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"VIDEOCONF","display":"videoconferencing"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"WRITTEN","display":"written"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"FAXWRIT","display":"telefax"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"HANDWRIT","display":"handwritten"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"MAILWRIT","display":"mail"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"ONLINEWRIT","display":"online written"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"EMAILWRIT","display":"email"},{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ParticipationMode","code":"TYPEWRIT","display":"typewritten"}]}}
