	<h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
<p>
This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="../list.html">List</a> resource within the 
<a href="daf.html">DAF FHIR IG</a>. This profile identifies which core data elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets must be <i>Supported</i> by DAF actors.
For the definition of <i>Supported</i> please refer to <a href="daf.html">DAF FHIR IG</a>. The data elements identified by the profile are based on ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC and DAF use cases. 
The mappings between the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data elements and DAF data elements are captured in the table below, where the first column identifies the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data element name, 
the second column maps the ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC data elements to DAF data elements which are derived from ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC standards and DAF use cases and lastly the third column identifies the mapping to FHIR resources and attributes.

	<p><b>*</b>: The DAF-MedicationList summarizes information from other DAF medication profiles. This profile supports three types of medication lists:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Admission Medications - Contains the medications taken by the patient prior to and at the time of admission to the facility (LOINC: 42346-7). This list will contain instances of DAF-MedicationStatement and DAF-MedicationOrder.</li>

		<li>Medications - The DAF-MedicationsList contains a patient's current medications and pertinent medication history (LOINC: 10160-0).  At a minimum, the currently active medications are listed. An entire medication history is an option. Typically a DAF Responder system is expected to maintain only one current medication list per patient outside of an individual episode or encounter. This list will contain instances of DAF-MedicationStatement, DAF-MedicationOrder, and may include instances of  DAF-MedicationDispense and DAF-MedicationAdministration.</li>

		<li>Discharge Medications - Contains the medications the patient is intended to take after discharge (LOINC: 75311-1). Current, active medications must be listed. This list will contain instances of DAF-MedicationOrder.</li>

	</ul>

  <li><a href="../extensibility.html">FHIR Extensibility</a> defines how extensions can be applied to FHIR resources and data types. 
  Specifically the <a href="../extension-data-absent-reason.html">data-absent-reason</a> extension can be used to code data elements with missing information when appropriate.
