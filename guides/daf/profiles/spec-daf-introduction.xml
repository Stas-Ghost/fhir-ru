	<h3>Meaningful Use Data Element Mapping</h3>
	<p>
		The DAF Specimen profile mapping does not have a direct mapping to Meaningful Use elements. The DAF team added this profile in response to DSTU 2 ballot comments. For an overview of how the DAF profiles and data elements were derived from ONC 2014 Edition S&amp;CC please refer to <a href="daf.html#DataMapping">DAF FHIR IG</a> data mapping section.
