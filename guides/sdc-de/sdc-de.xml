    the normal order for this file is:
      value sets
      concept maps
      profiles
      dictionaries
      examples
      pages      
      
    order rules:
    
    -->
  <!-- 
    value seta. This is just a file name. everything else of interest is in the value set 
    <valueSet source="filename, relative to this file"/> 
    value sets don't have to be listed here; they can be loaded implicitly by referring to them
    in a spreadsheet, or by including them in bundles. So the primary use here is if you 
    want to include other valuesets not directly referenced in a spreadsheet (e.g. imports
    in a value set))

  <valueset source="valueset-dataelement-sdccode.xml"/>
  
  <!-- 
    concept maps: same as value sets, except that there's no way to load them implicitly (though you can define them in a spreadsheet)
    <conceptMap source="filename, relative to this file"/> 
    you don't have to load the value sets prior to loading the concept maps that refer to them
  -->
  <!--
    profiles. You have to list all the profiles that are in this implementation guide. 
    <profile source=filename, relative to this file" type="[see below]"/> 
    there's two types: 
      spreadsheet - loads as a normal spreadsheet
      bundle - loads as a bundle of structure definitions (and possibly value sets and concept maps)
    all the rest of the information is extracted from the targets
    
    note: profiles are loaded in order. Derived profiles must be loaded after the profiles they are derived from.
