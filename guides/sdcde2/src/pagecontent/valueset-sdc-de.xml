    <h3>Scope and Usage</h3>
    <p>
      This profile sets expectations for use of the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset.html">ValueSet</a> resource within the 
      <a href="{{site.data.refs.sdc}}sdc.html">Structured Data Capture</a> implementation guide.  This includes
      identifying which core elements and extensions must be supported.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this profile, <i>Supported</i> means that clients SHALL be capable of processing the element/extension and use the information to control the display
      and information capture associated with the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset.html">ValueSet</a>.  It means that servers SHALL be capable of persisting those elements and returning them in response to requests.  For systems rendering <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}questionnaire.html">Questionnaires</a>, these <i>Supported</i> elements and extensions must be supported in the rendering of allowed choices associated with questions.

    <h3>Boundaries and Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      This profile relies on the use of the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset-extensions.html">valueset-extensions</a> profile which defines a number of less common properties for value sets, several of which are mandated for this profile.
      It also makes use of the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}rendering-extensions.html">rendering-extensions</a> which defines rendering information for display names and labels of codes.
