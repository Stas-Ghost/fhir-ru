<h2>Clinical Quality Improvement Framework (CQIF) Implementation Guide</h2>

<p><i>This draft of the CQIF IG is part of a FHIR snapshot that will be used to support the January 2016 FHIR connect-a-thon. In particular, the CDS-on-FHIR track will use this guide and the new FHIR CQF-related resources to support various clinical quality improvement scenarios.</i></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This Implementation Guide is prepared as a Universal Realm Specification with support from the <a href="http://cqframework.info">Clinical Quality Framework (CQF) initiative</a>, which is a public-private partnership sponsored by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) to harmonize standards for clinical decision support and electronic clinical quality measurement.</p>

<p>The CQIF Implementation Guide provides profiles and operation definitions to enable multiple quality-related use cases, including decision support request/response, quality measurement evaluation, as well as knowledge artifact representation and sharing.</p>

<a name="background"/>
<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The CQIF Implementation Guide is built by the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Information (CQI) HL7 Work Groups, with input and coordination from the FHIR Infrastructure and Service Oriented Architecture HL7 Work Groups.</p>

<p>The Clinical Quality Framework initiative has focused on harmonizing the historically disjoint specifications used by the Clinical Quality Measurement and Clinical Decision Support communities. Specifically, the initiative has focused on the specifications used to represent knowledge artifacts within the two communities. The strategy employed has been to break the conceptual content of knowledge artifacts into three core components:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Metadata - Descriptive information about the artifact and its content</li>
	<li>Clinical Information - The representation used to carry clinical information about the patient or population of concern within a given artifact</li>
	<li>Logic - The representation used to convey the logic involved in the artifact</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Clinical Quality Framework Conceptual Components" src="cqframework-components-diagram.jpg"/>

<p>The first component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=391">Clinical Quality Common Metadata Conceptual Model</a>, an informative document harmonizing metadata requirements between Quality Measurement and Decision Support artifacts.</p>

<p>The second component has resulted in the QUICK <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=378">Conceptual</a> and Logical Models, a harmonization of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=338">Virtual Medical Record (vMR)</a> used in Decision Support and the <a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm">Quality Data Model (QDM)</a> used in Quality Measurement, and realized in FHIR as the QICore profiles.</p>

<p>And finally, the third component has resulted in the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=400">Clinical Quality Language Specification</a>, a harmonization of the expressive capabilities of the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=337">Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification (CDS KAS)</a> (produced by the Health eDecisions (HeD) S&amp;I Framework Initiative), and the <a href="http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=97">Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF)</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the ongoing CQF initiative pilot efforts, these developing specifications are being used to support knowledge artifact sharing, as well as evaluation of knowledge artifacts as part of decision support request/response and measure evaluation.</p>

<p>This implementation guide continues the harmonization of quality domain specifications by defining an approach to using a FHIR server as a component of a knowledge system in one of two roles:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Knowledge Repository - As a knowledge artifact repository for sharing and distributing knowledge artifact definitions</li>
	<li>Knowledge Service - As a knowledge service providing for the evaluation of knowledge modules such as decision support artifacts and quality measures.</li>
</ol>

<p>As such, this implementation guide references resources in the base specification, as well as defines profiles that support multiple use cases in the clinical quality improvement and measurement space. From the perspective of a Knowledge Author, this IG specifies the approach to representing knowledge artifacts within FHIR.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a Knowledge Content Provider, this IG defines search functionality for using a FHIR server as a knowledge artifact repository.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a Knowledge Service Provider, this IG defines operations and profiles in support of evaluating quality measures, and defining a service for guidance request and response, consistent with the approach taken by the current Decision Support Specification.</p>

<p>And finally, from the perspective of a Knowledge Service Consumer, this IG defines the expected available operations and behavior of a knowledge service.</p>

<a name="scope"/>
<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>The CQIF Implementation Guide currently focuses on the Decision Support aspects of the Clinical Quality domain. However, this IG has been developed in coordination with the Clinical Quality Information Work Group sponsored project to build FHIR representations for Clinical Quality Measures. As a result of that coordination, many of the profiles defined in this implementation guide are shared by that effort. The scope of this implementation guide therefore broadly falls into two categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="cqif-common.html">Common aspects of clinical quality</a></li>
	<li><a href="cqif-cds-on-fhir.html">Decision Support-specific aspects of clinical quality</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The common aspects are concerned with the general representation of knowledge modules. The Decision Support-specific aspects then build on those profiles to define the guidance request/response operation, and representation of Decision Support-specific artifacts including rules, order sets, and documentation templates.</p>

<p>This implementation guide focuses on several primary use cases:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sharing - The representation of computable, shareable knowledge artifacts</li>
	<li>Evaluation - The evaluation of knowledge artifacts with respect to a particular patient or population</li>
	<li>Distribution - Functionality required to enable a searchable artifact repository</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ballot Objectives</h3>

<p>For this ballot cycle, we are presenting this implementation guide as a comment-only ballot with the objective of gathering community feedback. We welcome any comments, criticisms and suggestions on any topic, but in particular, we seek feedback on the following areas:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The representation of knowledge modules in general, and decision support artifacts in particular. The guide is constructed to allow knowledge modules to be represented either as potentially generated wrappers around existing specifications such as the Clinical Decision Support Knowledge Artifact Specification, or as first-class FHIR structures modeling the artifact content (such as order set items and rule actions) directly. Clearly there are pros and cons to both approaches; we seek community feedback on the preferred direction, or whether both options should continue to be supported.</li>
	<li>The mechanisms used for referencing logic from within knowledge artifacts. In particular, the use of the "content" element to allow Clincal Quality Language and Expression Logical Model content to be attached directly, versus requiring such content to be addressed through a library reference.</li>
	<li>The use of FHIR operations as the protocol for defining artifact evaluation requests and responses. In particular, the ability to bundle multiple requests into a single operation, as well as the use of a generic FHIR operation for any module evaluation, versus defining an evaluation specific to a given knowledge module.</li>
	<li>The use of FHIR interactions in general as a mechanism for enabling knowledge module repository and distribution functionality.</li>
</ul>
