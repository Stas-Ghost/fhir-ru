        <p>The cardiomediastinum is within normal limits. The trachea is midline. 
                    The previously described opacity at the medial right lung base has cleared. 
                    There are no new infiltrates. There is a new round density at the left hilus, 
                    superiorly (diameter about 45mm). A CT scan is recommended for further evaluation. 
                    The pleural spaces are clear. The visualized musculoskeletal structures and the
                    upper abdomen are stable and unremarkable.</p>
